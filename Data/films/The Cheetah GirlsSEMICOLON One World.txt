'''''The Cheetah Girls: One World''''' (also known as '''''The Cheetah Girls 3''''' or '''''The Cheetah Girls 3: One World''''') is a [[2008]] [[Disney Channel Original Movie]]. It is the third and final film of ''[[The Cheetah Girls]]'' film trilogy and premiered on [[August 22]], 2008. This is the only film to date where [[Raven-Symoné]] doesn't appear.

==Plot==
With Galleria at the University of Cambridge in England, Chanel ([[Adrienne Bailon]]), Dorinda ([[Sabrina Bryan]]), and Aqua ([[Kiely Williams]]) are cast in the lavish new Bollywood movie "''Namaste Bombay''". The Cheetah Girls travel across the globe to India. There, they meet Rahim (Rupak Ginn), the man cast as the lead, whom they realize is attractive, yet somewhat clumsy. After meeting the movie's choreographer, Gita (Deepti Daryanani), a dance battle erupts between themselves and Gita with her backup dancers. They subsequently discover that the musical's director, Vikram "Vik" (Michael Steger), must choose only one Cheetah for the role as the budget is only enough for one star.

When it becomes apparent that they must travel home, they are upset, until realizing they may each try out for the lead. Though they all make a promise to be fair in the competition, situations arise in which each member becomes jealous of the others' specific talents. Chanel befriends Vik, Dorinda befriends Rahim, and Aqua befriends a boy she has been in contact with since before leaving America, Amar (Kunal Sharma). Each girl is led to believe the producer of the film, Khamal (Roshan Seth), Vik's uncle, will choose her after the audition. Chanel is told because she is the better singer, she will receive the role, while Dorinda is promised the role as she is the best dancer, while Aqua is convinced the coveted role will be hers as she is the best actress. The three Cheetahs audition against one another with Chanel being awarded the role, which she later refuses realizing, as do the other Cheetahs, that friendship and unity are more important than furthering their individual or group careers.

After refusing the role, they set to convince Khamal to award Gita as the lead, to which he reluctantly agrees, ending in a scene from "''Namaste Bombay''" in which the Cheetahs sing and dance the titular song, "One World".

==Production==
According to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to [[India]] to star in a Bollywood production. Like ''[[The Cheetah Girls 2]]'', it was filmed on location in a foreign country. In an interview, Bailon stated the movie would film for a three month period, in India, and that she had been doing research for the film. She also stated that "all of the original cast will be back". However, [[Raven-Symoné]] later confirmed that she would not return for this film as she was busy with her fourth studio album and was filming movies such as ''[[College Road Trip]]''. Though some reports state that she and Kiely Williams did not get along during production of the second movie, Symone refused to reprise her character a third time if it meant working with her. Nearly a decade later on a Instagram livestream with Williams, Symoné would reveal she did not appear in the third film due to feeling "excluded" and "ostracized" and the other cast members acting "clique-ish" during production of ''The Cheetah Girls 2''.

Filming began in Udaipur, India during March 2008. Like ''[[High School Musical 2]]'', Disney featured a "play your part" role, where viewers and fans could choose elements of the film.

During the premiere airing of ''[[Camp Rock]]'', the first of many ''Road to "Cheetah Girls One World"'' segments debuted.
