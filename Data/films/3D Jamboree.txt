|language = English}}'''''3D Jamboree''''' is a [[1956]] 3D film starring [[Jimmie Dodd]], [[Roy Williams]], and the [[Mouseketeers]]. The film featured songs and routines by the troupe, and also included two Disney cartoon shorts that were filmed in 3D: ''[[Melody (Adventures in Music)|Melody]]'' and ''[[Working for Peanuts]]''.

The film was shown at the [[Mickey Mouse Club Theater]] at [[Disneyland]] from 1956 to [[1964]] and was the only color appearance of the original ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' cast and sets. The film has not been seen since it stopped running at Disneyland, though clips were shown in the [[1995]] documentary ''The Mickey Mouse Club Story''.
