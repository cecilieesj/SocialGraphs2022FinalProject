==Synopsis==
Nona, a grandmother who plans to spend her day off by shutting out the world to watch her favorite TV show, “E.W.W. Smashdown Wrestling.” However, when her 5-year-old granddaughter Renee is unexpectedly dropped off, Nona is caught between her two favorite things. Renee wants to play while the normally-doting Nona wrestles with wanting to watch the Smashdown, leading to a decisive showdown between the two, and a loving compromise.

==Plot==
Nona, is the elderly landlord to a building. On her day off, she tunes in to her favorite show ''E.W.W. Smashdown Wrestling'', a past time she shared with her late husband. She suddenly gets a knock on the door and discovers her granddaughter Renee has been dropped off by her mother. She takes her and and sits down to continue watching the show. However, Renee, the ever excitable child, continues to get in the way of Nona's television watching.

Nona tries to distract Renee with crayons, Lego and her dog Baby, but Renee keeps finding ways to get in Nona's way of watching television. Eventually, Renee catches what Nona is watching and tries to emulate what she sees by jumping from the stairs. Nona rushes up to catch her and accidentally knocks over the television; damaging it. Nona cries over the one thing that connected her to her husband. Seeing how sad she is, Renee emulates a wrestler for her and they enter a fantasy sequence of the two of them wrestling against each other. Nona and Renee laugh together.

In a post credits scene, Nona is on the couch with a sleeping Baby and Renee on top of her as the latter's favorite show ''Kitty Kitty Dance Party'' plays. Nona tries to reach for the remote, but it falls to the floor, frustrating her.
