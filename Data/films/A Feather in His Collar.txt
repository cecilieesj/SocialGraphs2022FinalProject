'''''A Feather in His Collar''''' is a [[1946]] animated short starring [[Pluto]].

==Synopsis==
Made for the Community Chests of America, Pluto demonstrates his community spirit by donating his collection of bones.

==Characters==
*[[Pluto]]

==Trivia==
*This is the very first cartoon to use what would become the post-1947 Pluto cartoon theme, where [[Mickey Mouse]] is heard (voiced by either [[Walt Disney]] or [[Jimmy MacDonald]]) saying, "Hey, Pluto!", along with Pluto's barks in the middle of the music). However, the theme would not actually be used in the actual Pluto cartoons themselves until ''[[Rescue Dog]]'' in 1947.
