'''''The Cheapest Muppet Movie Ever Made!''''' was an idea for a film that [[Jim Henson]], Jerry Juhl, and [[Frank Oz]] originally first developed in [[1985]].

The script was again mentioned as a next movie for the Muppets in September [[2009]] as discussed at the [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]]. It was later set aside yet again in favor of ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''.<ref>[http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/05/03/the-muppets-are-coming-american-woman-goes-viral-on-memorial-day-lost-this-wednesday/ MTV - "The Muppets Are Coming!
