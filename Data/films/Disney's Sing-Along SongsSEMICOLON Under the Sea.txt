It features songs that are all themed around water. It was notably the first ''Sing-Along Songs'' video to feature familiar tunes not from Disney movies, set to clips from Disney movies and cartoons (merely marked as "Disney scenes"). It is hosted by [[Ludwig Von Drake]].

==Description==
''Songs are for sharing, and learning the words to your favorite Disney songs has never been so much fun! Just sing along to the on-screen lyrics as you enjoy classic Disney characters in their most memorable musical scenes!''

''Dive into these wonderful water tunes with your host Professor Ludwig von Drake as he introduces a great collection of songs and scenes from Peter Pan, The Rescuers, and many other top films and cartoons! You'll also meet Sebastian, the calypso-swinging crab from The Little Mermaid, the most popular animated feature film of all time! Sebastian will teach you the lyrics to the award-winning hits, "Under the Sea" and "Kiss the Girl"!''
