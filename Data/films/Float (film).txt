==Synopsis==
A father discovers that his son floats, which makes him different from other kids. To keep them both safe from the judgement of the world, Dad hides, covers, and grounds him. But when his son's ability becomes public, Dad must decide whether to run and hide or to accept his son as he is.

==Plot==
A father is playing with his newborn son Alex in the front yard of his house. While showing him a dandelion, Alex proceeds to float, surprising him. Watchful eyes begin to concern him as he grabs Alex and brings him back inside the house. Now 4-years-old, Alex continues floating all over the darkened house as the father has become a hermit with a disheveled appearance. He keeps his son on a leash and stuffs his backpack with rocks to keep him down, though it is later shown to not do much. They leave the house while trying to avoid the neighbors.

The father pauses in front of a playground and watches the other kids play, but turns to see that Alex has escaped and is interacting with the other children by floating, shocking and confusing everyone. The father hurriedly grabs his son who begins to kick and scream while choking on his hoodie, resulting in his father yelling "Why can't [you] just be normal?!" (The only moment of dialogue in the film). Alex stops floating and looks down sadly while putting on his hood. As he looks at all the park attendees, the father, feeling guilty over what he has done over the past few years to his son, cradles him and sits on the swing set. He begins to swing back and forth, reinvigorating his son, and launches him in the air. Alex continues to fly as his father happily runs around underneath him.

==Trivia==

*Alex's ability to float is said to be a metaphor for most childhood related mental differences such as autism and ADD/ADHD.
*This is the 5th Pixar short film to have dialogue (albeit just one line).
*In the scene when the father goes to his desk before he notices Alex coloring the ceiling, a toy on the table bears much resemblance to the Thomas and Friends character, Harold the Helicopter.
