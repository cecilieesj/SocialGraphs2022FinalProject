The film was produced with cel animation and 2-D collage elements, a look developed by production designer John Kleber. From a set of four short/featurettes planned by Disney and MovieToons (to be titled "''Totally Twisted Fairy Tales''"), which was also to include "Jack in the Beanstalk", "The Three Little Pigs", and a fourth cartoon that was never finalized. The idea was to make a more adult short, by combining Disney artists and high-quality writers and their takes on classic fairy tales; however, only '''''Redux Riding Hood''''' was released, in animation festival showings.
