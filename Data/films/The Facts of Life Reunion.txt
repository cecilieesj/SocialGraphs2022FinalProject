Nancy McKeon did not attend allegedly due to scheduling conflicts with her television series ''The Division''.

''The Facts of Life Reunion'' was filmed from [[September 10]], 2001, to [[October 8]], 2001, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The movie aired as a presentation of ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' on [[ABC]] (even though the original series aired on [[NBC]]) Sunday [[November 18]], 2001, and was produced by Berger Queen Productions, Lawrence Mark Productions, Columbia TriStar Domestic Television, [[Walt Disney Television]] and [[Buena Vista Television]].

==Synopsis==
A widowed Mrs. Garrett is heading back to America on a cruise ship, ready for a new life and also looking forward to seeing her "girls" again, all of whom have grown into successful, independent women:

* Blair owns Warner Enterprises, which includes a stable of hotels, and is married to Tad Warner, without children.
* Natalie now serves as a producer at CNN, juggling an active love life with a frenetic work schedule that takes her all over the world.
* Tootie, now preferring to be called by her real name, Dorothy, is a [[Hollywood]]-based talk show host and the mother of a 10-year-old girl, Tisha.
* Jo, now a police officer, is still married to Rick Bonner and they have a daughter, Jamie.

Natalie has talked all the girls and Mrs. Garrett into spending the Thanksgiving holiday together back in Peekskill, NY. When Jo is unable to attend the reunion because of work, her teenage daughter, Jamie, comes instead in her absence. Trouble soon starts when Natalie receives two different marriage proposals, so it's up to the girls to help solve Natalie's predicament. Over the course of the holiday, the girls reveal to one another the personal troubles they face in their adult years and discover that, despite the time that has passed, they need each other's friendship more than ever.

== Trivia ==
Had the entire Facts of Life cast reunited for this movie, it would've fulfilled a prediction in the 1994 Simpsons episode Bart Gets Famous where Lisa Simpson "reunited the entire Facts of Life cast." By 2021, however, Entertainment Weekly dubbed Lisa Whelchel, Mindy Cohn, and Kim Fields as the show's "three original actors;" https://ew.com/tv/the-facts-of-life-original-cast-members-reunite-on-live-in-front-of-a-studio-audience/ unlike Whelchel, Fields and Cohn, McKeon was not featured in the show's first season.
