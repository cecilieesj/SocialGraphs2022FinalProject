==Synopsis==
Avalon’s not ready to process the loss of her mother, but when she’s put in charge of a 4-year-old for one night, she finds more comfort than she ever could have expected.

==Plot==
Avalon arrives in time to see 4-year-old Noah's parents leaving for the day while she stays to babysit. Before leaving, Noah's dad acknowledges that Avalon recently experienced a tragedy though she brushes it aside. The two play for a while, having fun with hide-and-seek and jumping on the bed. While playing, Noah notices a small tattoo on Avalon's arm and plays with her hair before deducing that she is sad. As she prepares Noah's bath, she tells him to play by himself, although Noah wants to play with her, but she is crying. Avalon later discovers that Noah wandered into the street and nearly got hit by a car. She comforts him in the street, then brings him back inside for his bath.

While preparing him for bed, he asks for an imaginary bedtime story. She tells the story of Lily, a girl who loved telling secrets to a tree, but that one day the tree was struck by lightning in the middle of the night. Noah deduces that Avalon is sad because her mother died from illness. While Avalon admits that everyone dies eventually, she is happy that she gets to spend time with him and the two pretend to be tigers as they play with each other.
