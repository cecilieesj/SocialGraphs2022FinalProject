'''''Inferior Decorator''''' is an animated short starring [[Donald Duck]].

==Synopsis==
Spike the Bee doesn't understand why he can't get pollen out of Donald's new flowered wallpaper.

== Plot ==
Spike singing peacefully suddenly hears Donald sing. Watching the duck sing and set up wallpaper with flowers on it, Spike believes that it's a real flower and tries to get pollen without succeeding. Donald, noticing the bee, decides to play a nasty trick on him.

Spike angrily tries to sting Donald, who tries to hide in the wallpaper, but Spike notices and cuts it in the wallpaper with his stinger, exposing Donald's posterior. Spike then calls all the bees of his hive by the keyhole, and they all sting Donald's posterior one by one.
