'''''The Cat That Looked at a King''''' is a [[2004]] live-action/animation short film that was originally released on the 2004 DVD release of ''[[Mary Poppins]]''.

==Synopsis==
The film opens in the modern day with two British children looking at chalk drawings at the same location where Bert did his artwork in the original movie. (According to [[Julie Andrews]], the set was re-created, down to the last detail, using the originals.) Andrews, dressed in modern clothes, greets the children and takes them into the chalk drawing where they watch the tale unfold. A [[Cat (The Cat That Looked at a King)|cat]] ([[Tracey Ullman]]) comes into the presence of a [[King (The Cat That Looked at a King)|king]] ([[David Ogden Stiers]]) who loves the facts and figures of the world more than anything else.

Unfortunately, this includes his wife, the Queen ([[wikipedia:Sarah, Duchess of York|Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York]]). The cat and the King challenge each other to three questions each: if the Cat wins, she gets the kingdom but if the King wins, he will become the smartest man in the universe. The Cat wins all her questions whilst the King wins none. When the King tells them he does not know who he is anymore, the Cat shows an image of him dancing with the Queen. She declines her prize and is given a brooch as a token of thanks by the Queen. The children and Andrews return to the park entrance, where Andrews denies that she took them into the painting, as she did in the film.
