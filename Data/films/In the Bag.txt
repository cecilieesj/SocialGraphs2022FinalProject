}}'''''In the Bag''''' is a [[Humphrey the Bear]] cartoon that was released on [[July 27]], [[1956]]. It was the last Disney short film to be distributed by RKO Radio Pictures.

==Synopsis==
After the summer visitors have finally left Brownstone Park, Ranger Woodlore sets up a plan to get the bears to help him clean up the park. He gets them cleaning and dancing to a snappy work song, but once the bears realize that it's a trick, he is forced to find another strategy.

==Song==
The catchy tune featured in "In the Bag" was so popular that Disney released a version of it (with similar instrumentation and different vocals) as a single, "[[Humphrey Hop|The Humphrey Hop]]". The song was sung again by Woodlore to his Brownstone Bears in the ''[[House of Mouse]]'' episode "[[Humphrey in the House]]", where they serve as the [[House of Mouse (night club)|House]]'s "clean-up crew."

==Characters==
*[[Humphrey the Bear]] (voiced by [[Jimmy MacDonald]])
*[[J. Audubon Woodlore]] (voiced by [[Bill Thompson]])
*[[Smokey the Bear]] (voiced by Jackson Weaver)

==Trivia==
*This is the final Disney short produced in CinemaScope; from ''[[A Cowboy Needs a Horse]]'' onward, most shorts would return to being produced in the Academy ratio, albeit formatted to mask well at the widescreen aspect ratio of most theater screens.

*In ''[[Cars 3]]'', [[Mater]] can be heard singing the catchyÂ tune to this short as he cleans up the junkyard.

*A version of it is heard in ''[[The Wonderful Autumn of Mickey Mouse]]''.
