==Plot==
[[File:Party Central "Stealing The Party" Clip|thumb|right|250px|"Stealing the Party" clip]][[Mike Wazowski|Mike]] and [[James P. Sullivan|Sulley]] are visiting [[Monsters University (institution)|Monsters University]] for the weekend to see how their [[Oozma Kappa]]-brothers are doing. The fraternity is throwing their first party, but no one's shown up to it yet—but fortunately for them, Mike and Sulley (who had a feeling that something like this) have a plan to liven up OK's house party. Using a borrowed [[Door|door]] station, they sneak into a party at the [[Roar Omega Roar]] fraternity and steal all of its food, drinks and guests to fill the Oozma Kappa house (as Mike and Sulley put it, "We're not just gonna '''''throw''''' the biggest party of the year—we're gonna '''''steal''''' it!"). The supply runs take them through the closet doors of a married couple's bedroom, repeatedly disturbing their sleep. [[Johnny Worthington III]] eventually arrives at ROR's party, only to find it empty. 

Once they have the party fully stocked, [[Scott "Squishy" Squibbles]]' mother, [[Sheri Squibbles|Sheri]], walks in on it while doing a load of laundry. She is angry with the fraternity, but only because they did not invite her. She also saw the door and thought they were "door jamming". Squishy tried to deny everything at first, before asking what door jamming was. After lighting a bonfire on the front lawn with a scream canister, Sheri introduces the crowd to door jamming. This involves jumping from the roof and landing safely on the lawn after passing through the two doors, to the humans' terror. The guests congratulate the Oozma Kappas (along with Mike and Sulley) for putting together such a great party, with many of the guys now wanting to pledge to Oozma Kappa.

In a post-credits scene, the husband and wife wake up their young son, Timmy, and ask if they can sleep with him. They say that there are monsters in their closets, to which their son vehemently replies, "That's what I've been trying to tell you!"
