}}'''''Winnie the Pooh Discovers the Seasons''''' is an educational short film made by the Walt Disney Educational Media Company, released to schools on [[September 6]], [[1981]].

==Plot==
[[Christopher Robin]] presents [[Winnie the Pooh|Pooh]] with an interesting new giftâ€”a calendar. Pooh has never seen one before, and Christopher Robin explains that it's a way of keeping track of the days, weeks, months and seasons. The calendar stops at each season, as we watch Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit and Owl in the [[Hundred Acre Wood]] exploring the world around them and noticing the changes. Among them: the water in the pond becomes hard and slick when it gets cold.

== Cast ==
* [[Hal Smith]] as [[Winnie the Pooh]] and [[Owl (Winnie the Pooh)|Owl]]
* Kim Christianson as [[Christopher Robin]]
* [[Ray Erlenborn]] as [[Rabbit]]
* [[Laurie Main]] as [[Mr. Narrator (character)|Narrator]]
* [[John Fiedler]] as [[Piglet]]
* [[Wikipedia:Ron Feinberg|Ron Feinberg]] as [[Eeyore]]

==Trivia==
*This was the first animated Disney short to use Hanna-Barbera-produced sound effects (aside from some of their late 70s live-action films that used a couple for cheesy humor like ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]''). Since then, they only used the sound effects for their television specials and shows, while they continued to use their classic [[Jimmy MacDonald]] cartoon sound effects until ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' in 1986 for their theatrical shorts and films.
*This short, alongside ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree]]'', are the only two films in the franchise to not feature [[Tigger]].
*This is the only film in the media other then ''[[Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin]]'' that does not feature [[Kanga]], [[Roo]], and [[Gopher]].

==Television==
*''[[Ludwig's Think Tank]]''
