'''''Stepsister from Planet Weird''''' is a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] which was released in June [[2000]].

==Summary==
'''Megan Larson''' is an ordinary teenage girl. Her workaholic father Fred and windsurfing mother '''Kathy''' are divorced, and Megan longs for them to get back together, as much as she wants her little brother '''Trevor''' to be less annoying. But the thing she wants the most is for a popular guy named Cutter to be her boyfriend, so her dearest wish is to be in with the popular group. But things get more out of control when her mother meets '''Cosmo Cola''', a nice but very strange man. He has a pretty and very intelligent daughter named '''Ariel''' who is even weirder than her dad. Ariel hides under her father's car when the wind blows, talks in a sophisticated manner, wears many layers to 'protect her essence', cannot ride a bicycle despite training wheels and a football helmet, and mostly complains that she hates the town where she resides and wants to return to her hometown in Yukon to be with her boyfriend, '''Fanul'''. Worst of all for Megan Larson, the kids at school think that the way Ariel behaves is 'cool and revolutionary'. Her teachers believe her mannerisms are poetic, and she even gets to sit in the popular table on her first day which attracts Cutter's attention.

What Megan does not realize is that Ariel and her father are aliens. Because Ariel's father was a freedom fighter on their home planet, they had to escape to Earth, leaving behind their home, Ariel's mother, and Ariel's boyfriend Fanul (the son of the emperor). On her home planet, every citizen is a gaseous bubble that floats carelessly, so Ariel is very uncomfortable with the solid objects of Earth. She hates everything on Earth: her name, the wind that blows, the solid objects and people, "every time I look at this horrid vehicle; the rubbery flesh, the flat face, the ghastly yellow hair that grows out of this hideous skull, I can only think I am grotesque." Ariel and Megan become enemies although Megan's mother becomes engaged to Ariel's father. As Ariel and Megan realize that they both want to separate their parents, they agree on a temporary alliance to achieve their common goal. However, none of their plans work well.

When Megan begins to suspect something especially unusual is occurring, she discovers that both Ariel and Cosmo are aliens. Fanul and his emperor father arrive to take Ariel and Cosmo home, but Fanul turns on his father after Megan, Ariel and Cutter convince him of the benefits of freedom. As Ariel's race is vulnerable to the wind, she, Megan, Cutter, Fanul and Trevor are able to defeat the emperor with a leaf blower and hairdryers. After the emperor is defeated, Cosmo marries Kathy, Megan and Fanul develop feelings for each other while Ariel and Cutter do the same, and Ariel and Megan become best friends. Also, Fanul plans to return home and take over as ruler as his father was killed, but also plans to make changes to the way things are run and grant the people freedom. Fanul promises to return to Earth occaisionally to visit Megan. Megan and Ariel realize that even though they are from different worlds they are a lot alike.
