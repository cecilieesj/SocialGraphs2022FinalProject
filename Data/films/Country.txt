'''''Country''''' is a [[1984]] American film which follows the trials and tribulations of a rural family as they struggle to hold onto their farm during the trying economic times experienced by family farms in 1980s [[United States|America]]. The film was written by William D. Wittliff and stars real-life couple Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard. The film was directed by Richard Pearce and was shot on location in Dunkerton [[Iowa]] and at Burbank's [[Walt Disney Studios]].

Lange, who also co-produced the film, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe award for her role. Then-U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] stated in his personal diary that this film "was a blatant propaganda message against our agri programs."
