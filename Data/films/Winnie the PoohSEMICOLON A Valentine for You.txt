It was initially broadcast as a one-hour special, where the timeslot was filled by the Pooh short, "[[Groundpiglet Day]]" and three shorts from the then-upcoming ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' TV show: "[[Pluto Gets the Paper: Bubble Gum]]", "[[Mickey's New Car]]" and "[[Maestro Minnie: William Tell Overture]]".

It was released on DVD only in 2004 as a double feature with ''[[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' episodes "[[Un-Valentine's Day]]" and "[[Three Little Piglets]]", then re-released on the same format on January 5, 2010 with the same two episodes as the 2004 DVD and the bonus episode "[[My Hero]]". It was released on Disney+ in February 11, 2022.

When Pooh and his friends discover that Christopher Robin has fallen in love with a girl, they believe that he won't have time for them anymore.

But Pooh decides to let the bug go so Christopher Robin can be happy with who he has now. The next morning, however, Pooh and his friends receive Valentine cards from Christopher Robin and they learn there's room in the heart for friends both old and new.
