'''''Timon & Pumbaa's Vacation Safari''''' is a humorous short nature documentary included within the [[2012]] and [[2017]] [[The Lion King 1½ (video)|home video releases]] of ''[[The Lion King 1½]]'', serving as the film's spin-off. The short combines animation as well as live-action footage of animals - specifically focusing on animals representing African fauna.

The short was first included in the [[2012]] DVD, Blu-ray and digital releases of ''The Lion King 1½'' where it was released on [[March 6]], [[2012]]  prior to the Diamond Edition of ''[[The Lion King]]'' returning to the [[Disney Vault]] on [[April 30]], [[2013]]. When ''The Lion King 1½'' was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray on [[August 29]], [[2017]] along with ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'', the short was included exclusively on the Blu-ray and digital formats of the home video's release, as the 2017 DVD edition has completely removed all bonus features.

==Plot==
[[Timon]] and [[Pumbaa]] are watching a movie via projector screen at the jungle waiting for everyone to watch. Soon as the movie starts, they see footage of live-action animals - specifically animals representing African fauna just as Pumbaa explains to Timon that there are many animals like the ones in the video seen in the [[Pride Lands]] and throughout the montage, Timon tells him that he is ruining the script he made. The scene loops into a {{WikipediaLink|hippopotamus}} swimming underwater, where Timon explains to Pumbaa that hippos can be extremely aggressive creatures, followed by Timon looking at a {{WikipediaLink|Nile crocodile|crocodile}} (whom he thinks it is an alligator) which Pumbaa tells Timon the difference between alligators and crocodiles. The next animal the two seen is the {{WikipediaLink|White rhinoceros|rhinoceros}} which Pumbaa explains to Timon that the rhinoceros' name originates from the Greek words for "horn" and "nose", explaining to him that despite their weak eyesight, rhinos have a great sense of hearing and scent.

After this, Pumbaa and Timon are commenting on the footage of {{WikipediaLink|warthog|warthogs}} and {{WikipediaLink|meerkat|meerkats}} like their own species, showing the differences of what makes these species unique. After Pumbaa tells Timon that meerkats like him are immune to venom from {{WikipediaLink|scorpion|scorpions}}, the former tells Timon that he has a scorpion on him which Timon overreacts, interrupting the movie for a bit, figuring out that Timon is safe after all. As Timon and Pumbaa continue watching the movie, they see footage of {{WikipediaLink|African elephant|African elephants}}, with Timon explaining that elephants can drink over forty gallons of water a day and communicate through bellowing. Pumbaa suddenly hears an overlapping stampede, which Timon mistakens them for their guests to which as the stampede arrives, the animals pass through the projector screen, causing Timon and Pumbaa's movie to become ruined. Pumbaa asks Timon if he can finish the hors d'oeuvres which Timon tells him to do so.

==Voice Cast==
*[[Kevin Schon]] as [[Timon]]
*[[Ernie Sabella]] as [[Pumbaa]]

==Trivia==
*On the start of the short, the projector screen features the opening credits on Timon and Pumbaa's "movie" where Timon is the only one "credited" on making this "movie" - hinting that Timon was the only one who "made" the "movie".
*Footage from [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] was used in the short - specifically focusing on animals from the [[Africa (Animal Kingdom)|Africa]] section of the park as confirmed by the short's ending.
