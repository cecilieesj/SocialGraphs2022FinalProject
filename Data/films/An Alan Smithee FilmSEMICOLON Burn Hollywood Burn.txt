'''''An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn''''' (the onscreen title is simply '''''Burn Hollywood Burn''''') is a [[1997]] comedy film and is regarded as one of the worst films of all time, scooping five awards (including Worst Picture) at the 1998 Golden Raspberry Awards. The film had an estimated budget of $10 million and grossed at least $52,850, being that it was only released in 19 theaters.

The film's creation set off a chain of events which would lead the Directors Guild of America to officially discontinue the Alan Smithee credit in 2000. Its plot (about a director attempting to disown a film) eventually described the film's own production; director Arthur Hiller requested that his name be removed after witnessing the final cut of the film by the studio.

==Plot==
A director by the name of Alan Smithee has been allowed to direct ''Trio,'' a big-budget action film starring [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Jackie Chan]]. The studio recuts the film, and when Smithee sees the results (which he describes as being "worse than ''Showgirls''") and realizes that he cannot use a pseudonym (because the only one allowed is "Alan Smithee") he steals the film and goes on the run, threatening to burn it.

The movie then proceeds to tell these events and their aftermath in the style of a docummentary, consisting in multiple interviews with the production crew and executives.

The movie ends with the studio deciding that given the destruction of the ''Trio,'' they will instead make a movie about its production and destruction, thus echoing the motion picture itself.

==Production==
The film was written (and produced, though he was not credited for it) by Joe Eszterhas. Filming took place between November 14, 1996 and January 24, 1997. The released film credits the Alan Smithee pseudonym as director. Arthur Hiller, the film's real director, objected to the way Eszterhas recut the film, and as a result, had his name removed. But in his autobiography ''Hollywood Animal'', Eszterhas claims that Hiller still sat in the editing room with him to make certain suggestions. In his entry on ''Burn Hollywood Burn'' for his "My Year of Flops" column, pop culture critic Nathan Rabin sarcastically commented that Hiller's decision to use the Alan Smithee credit was "very transparently not a stupid, stupid gimmick to raise interest in a terrible film."<ref>Rabin, Nathan. "[http://www.avclub.com/articles/my-year-of-flops-inside-hollywood-edition-case-fil,2298/ My Year Of Flops: Inside Hollywood Edition, Case File 109: An Alan Smithee Film: Burn, Hollywood, Burn]". [[AV Club]], 2008. Retrieved November, 2011.</ref>

== Release ==
The movie was first screened on the Mill Valley Film Festival on October 1997, and would eventually be released in 19 theaters in Febuary 20, 1998.

The movie was released on VHS and LaserDisc on August 26, 1998. It was released on DVD in April 6, 2004.

==Reception==
Film critic Roger Ebert gave zero stars, his lowest possible rating.

The film currently holds an 8% rating on Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: "A witless Hollywood satire whose hammy, obvious jokes are neither funny nor insightful of the movie business."
