'''''Sleeping Beauty''''' is a [[1959]] animated feature produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and originally released to theaters on [[January 29]], [[1959]], by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Film Distribution]]. The 16th animated feature in the [[Disney Animated Canon]], it was the last animated feature produced by [[Walt Disney]] to be based upon a fairy tale (after his death, the studio returned to the genre with ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''), as well as the last cel animated feature from Disney to be inked by hand before the studio switched to using the {{WikipediaLink|xerography}} process. It is also the first animated feature to be shot in {{WikipediaLink|Super Technirama 70}}, one of many large-format widescreen processes (only one more animated film, ''[[The Black Cauldron]]'', has been shot in Super Technirama 70). It spent nearly the whole decade of the 1950s in production: the story work began in [[1951]], the dialogue was recorded in [[1953]], animation production took from the same year the dialogue was recorded until [[1958]], and the musical score by [[George Bruns]], drawn almost entirely from the ballet ''{{WikipediaLink|The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Spyashchaya krasavitsa}}'' by {{WikipediaLink|Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky}}, was recorded in the same year animation production finished.

The film was originally a failure and did not make up the huge cost of the film. Along with the mixed critical reception, it was also noted to be the film that caused Walt Disney to lose interest in the animation medium. However, the subsequent re-releases proved massively successful, and critics and audiences have since praised it as a beautiful animated classic.

==Plot==
In the 14th Century, [[King Stefan]] and [[Queen Leah]] have a daughter, whom they called her [[Aurora]]. Everyone was invited to the christening ceremony, where Baby Aurora is betrothed to Young [[Prince Phillip]], the son of her dad's friend who rules a neighboring kingdom, [[King Hubert]]. Stefan and Hubert wanted to unite their respective kingdoms through a future marriage between their respective children.

At the Princess's christening, [[The Duke|the royal herald]] announces the arrival of the three good [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|fairies]] who came to bless her; [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Flora]] (in red), [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Fauna]] (in green), and [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Merryweather]] (in blue).
*Flora gives her the gift of beauty, which is described in a song as "gold of sunshine in her hair" and "lips that shame the red, red rose."
*Fauna gives her the gift of song, so she may sing like a nightingale.
But before Merryweather can give her gift to the princess, [[Maleficent]], a wicked fairy and self-proclaimed "mistress of all evil," appears on the scene. Angered at not being invited to the christening, she curses Aurora to die when she pricks her finger on a [[Spinning Wheel|spinning wheel]]'s spindle before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, leaving everyone horrified about Aurora's doomed future and her mother grabs her from the bed in disbelief.

Though Maleficent disappears, Flora and Fauna point out to Stefan that Merryweather hasn't given her gift to Princess Aurora yet. While Maleficent's magic is far too powerful for Merryweather to undo the curse, she does use her magic to soften the curse, whereby, instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep that will only be undone by Love's First Kiss. King Stefan, still fearful, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned as a preventative. Knowing Maleficent is extremely powerful and will stop at nothing to see her curse fulfilled, least of all a "bonfire", the fairies take Aurora to live with them in the [[Forest (Sleeping Beauty)|forest]], where they can keep her safe from any harm until she turns sixteen and the curse is made void. To protect her fully, they even change her name to Briar Rose to conceal her true identity.

In the [[Forbidden Mountain|Forbidden Mountains]], Maleficent berates her [[Maleficent's Goons|henchmen]] after realizing that they had been looking for a baby for sixteen years. As a last resort, she sends her raven, later named "[[Diablo]]," to look for Aurora.

Aurora grows into a very beautiful woman, with sunshine golden blonde hair, rose-red lips, violet eyes, and a beautiful singing voice. She is raised in a [[Aurora's Cottage|cottage]] in the forest by the fairies, whom she believes are her aunts. On her sixteenth birthday, while out picking berries, she sings to entertain her [[Forest Animals (Sleeping Beauty)|animal friends]]; her angelic voice gains the attention of Phillip, who has grown into a handsome young man and is out riding in the woods. When they meet, they instantly fall in love. Realizing that she has to return home, she flees from him without ever learning his name. Back at the cottage, while cleaning up the mess to prepare for Aurora's sixteenth birthday, Merryweather and Flora argue about the color of Aurora's dress for it being blue and or pink, attracting the attention of Diablo, who sends the news about Aurora's discovery to Maleficent. When Aurora returns, despite promising to meet him again, she is unable to return as her "aunts" choose that time to reveal the truth of her birth to her and to tell her that she is betrothed to a prince named Phillip, and she runs to her room heartbroken, neither she nor the fairies knowing that Aurora's beloved and betrothed are one and the same.

Meanwhile, Stefan and Hubert were having a conversation about their children's future, and Phillip returns home to tell Hubert about a peasant girl he met and wishes to marry despite his prearranged marriage to Aurora. Hubert tries to convince Phillip to marry Aurora instead of the peasant girl but fails.

[[File:PrincessAuroraSleeps.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Princess Aurora, the titular character in ''Sleeping Beauty''.]]
The fairies and Aurora return to the [[King Stefan's Castle|castle]]. Unfortunately, Maleficent uses her magic to lure Aurora away from her chamber and up into a tower, where an enchanted spinning wheel awaits her. The fairies go searching everywhere, trying to look for Aurora. But at Maleficent's hypnotic order, Aurora touches the spindle, thereby pricking her finger. By the time the fairies arrive in the same chamber where Aurora pricked her finger, they are too late to save Aurora. They gasped as Maleficent taunts them for their failed attempt to defeat her by revealing the fallen princess and disappearing, cackling in triumph. As had been foretold, Aurora has been put under a {{WikipediaLink|sleeping spell}}. Unwilling to break Stefan and Leah's hearts about Aurora's fate and heartbroken about their failure to protect her, the fairies place her on her bed with a red rose in her hand and cast a powerful spell on everyone in the kingdom, causing a deep sleep to fall over them until the fairies can find a way to break the curse. From a remark made by the drowsy Hubert, they realize that Phillip is both Aurora's beloved and the one fated to break the curse. But when they arrive at the cottage, they discover that the prince has been kidnapped by Maleficent and her goons to prevent him from kissing Aurora and breaking the evil fairy's spell. The good fairies sneak into Maleficent's lair to aid Phillip in escaping, arming him with a magical sword and shield. Warned by Diablo (who got turned into a stone by Merryweather), Maleficent attempts to thwart Phillip from reaching Stefan's castle with her magic and transforming herself into a gigantic fire-breathing dragon. After being cornered on a cliff, he flings his sword and impales her, sending her crashing down in destruction. The prince then climbs up to Aurora's chamber and removes the curse with a kiss. One by one, everyone else, including Stefan, Leah, and Hubert, awaken from their slumber.

A fanfare announces Aurora and Phillip's arrival in the throne room, where the teenage princess is happily reunited with her parents; she then dances with Phillip, each happy to learn that their betrothed and their beloved are one and the same. As Merryweather and Flora argue over the dress color again, the happy couple waltzes into the clouds and live happily ever after.

|quote=Imagination is the mold from which reality is created. Centuries ago, men of vivid imagination created the fairy tales which live to this day, even though in many cases the authors' names have been lost in the mist of antiquity. Of all these stirring legends of Princes and Princesses, of witches and fairies, and of the triumph of good over evil, none has ever been so inspirational to me as Sleeping Beauty.

====Reworking====
[[File:SleepingBeauty1959StorySketch16.jpg|thumb|250px|right|According to Charles Solomon, "Disney’s story crew kept very little of Perrault’s fairy tale, replacing it with a mixture of ''Snow White'' and a Hollywood boy-meets-girl story."<ref name="DisneyArchives" />]]In June [[1952]], the full storyboard presentation was completed, but Disney rejected it, concluding that this story approach was too similar to the studio's past efforts.<ref name="AudioCommentary2003" /><ref name="OnceUponADream" /> Because of this, the story team had to throw out the first version of the story and start it all over again, while deciding to keep a number of important story points from the early suggestions, such as the prince's acquaintance with the titular character before the fulfillment of the curse and, consequently, a shorter duration of her sleep, which lasted a hundred years in the original fairy tale.<ref name="DisneyArchives" /><ref name="Thomas3031" /> Part of Disney's difficulty was trying to make his third princess, who was named Aurora, different from [[Snow White]] or [[Cinderella (character)|Cinderella]]. First of all, it was decided to remove knowledge of her own plight from the princess, so she could be viewed simply as a person or a personality, since there would be no requirement to inform the character’s actions or behavior through her predicament. To do that, the story artists came up with an idea to have the fairies rear her up in a forest cottage, with the princess being completely unaware of her background or the danger she was in. Also, Aurora was given a different personality style—"a freshness and a modern sensibility" to make her more appealing to audience. At the same time, Walt considered it important to emphasize the character of the prince, who was named Phillip; this role had been minimized in ''Snow White'', because the draftsmanship of a realistic male figure was rather "crude" back then, but, since his animators' skills have improved over the years, Disney felt confident in expanding the prince’s role and enhancing his personality.<ref name="AudioCommentary2003" /><ref name="Thomas3031" /> Initially, the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which Aurora and Phillip would have met during a treasure hunt, organized by the king, but the idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline; instead, it was written that prince and princess would meet in the forest by random chance.<ref name="Thomas3031" /><ref name="Koenig104" /> Also, to further establish Phillip's role as Aurora's "true love", story artists came up with an idea to have Maleficent kidnap him and plot to keep him prisoner in her castle for a century, which would also serve as a twist on the centennial slumber from the original fairy tale.<ref name="VirtualGalleries" />
[[File:SleepingBeauty1959ProductionPhoto10.jpg|thumb|250px|left|More story sessions were held on ''Sleeping Beauty'' than on any previous Disney animated production.<ref name="FunFacts">{{Cite web

}}</ref>]]Trying to distinguish ''Sleeping Beauty'' from his past animated features story-wise, Walt also decided to go in a more serious direction of storytelling and make a movie without the subplots, like the mice in ''Cinderella'', concentrating on the "reality of the story and the subtlety of the main characters".<ref name="AudioCommentary2003" /><ref name="PicturePerfect" /> For example, originally the Three Good Fairies, who by that time had been renamed Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, were to rule over the domains, indicated by their names: Flora was to have charge of flowers and plants, Fauna was to oversee the animals and birds, and Merryweather was to control the climate. Although this notion offered many situations for humor, Disney discarded it, feeling that it led the main story nowhere.<ref name="AudioCommentary2003" /><ref name="Solomon28" /> He also personally cut out a number of gags and comical scenes involving fairies, feeling that they were too "slapsticky" and would be more fitting for [[Donald Duck]] shorts, but not for ''Sleeping Beauty''; one of these was a sequence in which Flora, Fauna and Merryweather unsuccessfully try to bake a birthday cake for Aurora, but in the end they accidentally blow up the oven.<ref name="PicturePerfect" /><ref>{{Cite book

}}</ref> Also, in the early versions of the story, Aurora was supposed to directly encounter with Maleficent, who would have tricked her into pricking the finger on the spindle. However, Walt felt that the "eerie, haunting presentation of a victim powerless in the hands of evil" would be the strongest and best statement for the film, so the scene was changed to have Maleficent lure Aurora to her doom under hypnosis, without interacting with her directly.<ref>{{Cite video

}}</ref> A key influence on Earle was the French illuminated manuscript the ''[[wikipedia:Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry|Très Riches Heures de Jean, Duc de Berri]]'', an opulent Book of Hours (a devotional volume that included Psalms, prayers, and a calendar of Church feasts); from it, he took the key colors for the film, such as the lapis lazuli blue of the knight’s banners, the yellow-green of Maleficent’s flames, the shell pink and paler blue of Aurora’s gown. Earle paired these historic influences with a second artistic vision: the modern painting of the early 20th century as interpreted by the artists of the innovative [[wikipedia:United Productions of America|UPA]] animation studio, whose films had flat, boldly colored and stylized characters and backgrounds.<ref name="PicturePerfect" /><ref name="StunningArt" />

Disney gave Earle a significant amount of freedom in designing the settings and selecting colors for the film. He also painted the majority of the backgrounds himself. He took much of his inspiration from medieval art (particularly the ''{{WikipediaLink|millefleur}}s'' style of 15th-century tapestries), which tended toward a certain flatness and perspective lessened, most notably the French manuscript that was written by the Limbourg Brothers. The elaborate paintings usually took seven to ten days to paint; by contrast, a typical animation background took only one workday to complete. Disney's decision to give Earle so much artistic freedom was not popular among the Disney animators, who had until the film exercised some influence over the style of their characters and settings.

====Character design and animation====
[[File:SleepingBeauty1959PrincessAuroraConceptDesign4.jpg|thumb|250px|Tom Oreb was the first Disney artist to receive the credit of "character stylist", indicating his influence on the design of the characters.]]
Because of the artistic depth of Eyvind Earle's paintings, it was decided for the characters of to be stylized so they could appropriately match the backgrounds. While the layout artists and animators were impressed with Earle's paintings, they eventually grew depressed at working with a style that many of them regarded as "too cold, too flat, and too modernist" for a fairy tale feature. A major problem was that the backgrounds were so detailed and busy that it was hard for the animators to make the characters stand out and read against them. Eyvind's request to have the decision in the case of character designs and their color schemes was also met with a rather negative reaction from the animators, who always had a lot of input into the design and color modeling of their characters up to this point. On one occasion, a few of them went up to see Walt and to complain about it, but he didn't back them on this, for he wanted the visual design to carry the picture, while also claiming that the inspirational art he commissioned in the past had homogenized the animators. Tom Oreb was tasked as character stylist that would not only inhabit the style of Earle's backgrounds, but also fit with the contemporary UPA style; likewise with Earle's background styling, the animators complained that Oreb's character designs were too rigid to animate. Unlike the most of the animators, the studio's top draftsmen, [[Marc Davis]] and [[Milt Kahl]], embraced Eyvind Earle's sophisticated style, what led to their appointment as supervising animators of the film's leading characters, Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip. Collaborating with Davis, Tom Oreb crafted a "leading lady of elegance", influenced by the features of {{WikipediaLink|Audrey Hepburn}}, who was a new film star at the time of ''Sleeping Beauty''<nowiki/>'s production. He incorporated the strong horizontal and vertical lines of the backgrounds into Aurora's design, while Marc slightly sharpened her features and clothes to blend with the settings' angular shapes, as well as added Art Nouveau and Art Deco into her hair. The final design, that perfectly complemented Earle’s backgrounds, was "more refined" than those of preceding Disney heroines, and thus required much more attention to detail than any animated character before. Quality control animator [[Iwao Takamoto]], who also was Marc Davis' assistant during the film's production, described working with refined drawings of Aurora as a "laborious job", and ultimately limited in-betweeners such as himself to completing only seven drawings per day.

[[File:Maleficent design.JPG|thumb|left|250px|In designing Maleficent, Marc Davis experimented with flamelike shapes and patterns of triangular color.]]
Marc Davis was also selected to supervise the design and animation of Maleficent and, by extension, her pet raven, Diablo. He decided to move on from the early suggestions for the character's design, that included more inhuman, "insect-like" elements, in favor of a more ominous figure, of whom he thought as a "giant vampire bat". Davis' primary inspiration was a religious painting from a Czechoslovakian art book he found in his home library, featuring a figure with the flame-like drapery that he thought would be great to use. He also added the horns and material, based on the bat's wings, around Maleficent's face to achieve what he called a "devil image", while her costume was endowed with a reptilian quality, foreshadowing the dragon into which she would transform at the film's climax. Marc's original designs featured red trim to Maleficent's robe to highlight its flame-like shape, but, in an act of artistic compromise, Eyvind Earle requested the change to lavender as red would come off too strong, in which Davis agreed to. [[Frank Thomas]] and [[Ollie Johnston]], who, on contrary to Davis and Kahl, struggled the most to adapt to Earle's style, were given the task of designing and animating Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. At first, Walt considered making the fairies identical, similarly to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], but Frank and Ollie felt that such an approach wouldn't be half as much fun, so they had to do a lot of talking to convince Walt to give the characters more distinctive looks and personalities. Ultimately, they also managed to reach the artistic compromise with Earle: the fairies received the required angularity in their costumes, based on geometrical shapes, but retained a "warm, round, cuddly" feel, akin to the previous Disney characters, with their facial features.

====Live-action reference====
[[File:SleepingBeauty1959LiveActionReference13.jpg|thumb|250px|Helene Stanley provides the reference of Briar Rose's dance for "[[Once Upon a Dream]]" scene.]]
Before the animation process began, a live-action reference version was filmed with live actors in costume serving as models for the animators. This was an important requirement of Walt, who wanted the animators to make the characters "as real as possible, near flesh and blood"; however, Milt Kahl objected to this method, considering it "a crutch, a stifling of the creative effort" and claiming that "anyone worth his salt in this business ought to know how people move." {{WikipediaLink|Helene Stanley}}, who previously provided the live-action reference for the title character in ''Cinderella'', was hired as a model for Aurora. As a part of the reference, she played in a blond wig and costumes specially designed by [[Alice Davis|Alice Estes]] at the behest of Marc Davis, then a student of the animator at {{WikipediaLink|Chouinard Art Institute}}. The only known surviving footage of Stanley as Aurora's live-action reference is a clip from the television program ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney|Disneyland]]'', which consists of the artists sketching her dancing with the woodland animals. Stanley also provided a reference for some scenes of Merryweather. The role of Prince Phillip was modeled by {{WikipediaLink|Ed Kemmer}}, who had played Commander Buzz Corry on the then-popular television show ''{{WikipediaLink|Space Patrol}}''. For the final battle sequence, Kemmer was photographed on a wooden buck. [[Cubby O'Brien]], then a [[Mouseketeers|Mouseketeer]] of the ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club|Mickey Mouse Club]]'', provided the reference for Phillip as a child. In addition to the voice acting, Eleanor Audley served as a model for Maleficent; occasionally she was replaced by Jane Fowler, who also provided the reference for Queen Leah. Among the actresses who performed in reference footage as the Three Good Fairies included {{WikipediaLink|Spring Byington}}, {{WikipediaLink|Frances Bavier}} ("Aunt Bea" from ''{{WikipediaLink|The Andy Griffith Show}}'') and {{WikipediaLink|Madge Blake}}; the voice actresses didn't fit for they weren't "pudgy" enough. The role of King Stefan was modeled by Hans Conried, who also recorded additional lines of dialogues in the same film. His companion in the role of [[Mr. Smee]], [[Don Barclay]], served as a model for King Hubert. [[Minstrel|Sir Minstrel]], who serves wine to the kings in the "[[Skumps]]" sequence, was modeled by {{WikipediaLink|Franklin Pangborn}}.

==Reception==
[[File:Sleeping Beauty 1990's Re-Release Poster.jpg|thumb|250px|1986's re-release poster.]]
During its original release in 1959, the film earned approximately $5.3 million in box office rentals. Its production costs, which totaled $6 million, made it the most expensive Disney film up to that point, and over twice as expensive as each of the preceding three Disney animated features: ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]'', and ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''. Its high production costs, coupled with the underperformance of much of the rest of Disney's 1959–[[1960]] release slate resulted in the company posting its first annual loss in a decade for the fiscal year 1960, and massive layoffs were done throughout the animation department.

The film was met with mixed reviews from critics, often citing the film being slowly paced and having little character development. Nevertheless, it has sustained a strong following and is today hailed as one of the best-animated films ever made, thanks to its stylized designs by painter Eyvind Earle who also was the art director for it, its lush music score, and its large-format 70 mm widescreen and stereophonic sound presentation.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a "Certified Fresh" 89% from 46 reviews with an average rating of 8.2/10. Its consensus states that "This Disney dreamscape contains moments of grandeur, with its lush colors, magical air, one of the most menacing villains in the Disney canon."

Like ''Alice in Wonderland'', which was not initially successful either, the film was never re-released theatrically in Walt Disney's lifetime. However, it had many re-releases in theaters over the decades. It was re-released theatrically in [[1970]], [[1979]] (in 70 mm 6 channel stereo, as well as in 35 mm stereo and mono), [[1986]] and [[1995]]. A [[1993]] re-release was planned, as it was advertised on the [[1992]] [[Walt Disney Classics|Classics]] VHS of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', but it was canceled. Its successful reissues have made it the second most successful on release in 1959, second to ''Ben-Hur'', with a lifetime gross of $51.6 million. When adjusted for ticket price inflation, the domestic total gross comes out to $478.22 million, placing it in the top 40 of films.

==Release==
Disney's distribution arm, [[Buena Vista Distribution]], originally released the film to theaters in both standard 35 mm prints and large-format 70 mm prints. The Super Technirama 70 prints were equipped with six-track stereophonic sound; some CinemaScope-compatible 35 mm Technirama prints were released in four-track stereo, and others had monaural soundtracks. On the initial run, it was paired with the short musical/documentary film ''Grand Canyon'' which won an Academy Award.

In [[1986]], the film was first released on both VHS and Laserdisc under the [[Walt Disney Classics|Classics collection]], becoming the first Disney Classics video to be digitally processed in Hi-Fi stereo. Then it underwent an extensive digital restoration in [[1997]], and that version was released on both VHS and Laserdisc again (this time with the Laserdisc in widescreen version, albeit letterboxed) as part of the [[Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection|Masterpiece collection]], and in [[2003]], it was released to DVD in a 2-disc "Special Edition" that included both the original widescreen version and a pan and scan version as well.

==Trivia==
*The film's copyright was renewed on [[June 12]], [[1986]].<ref>[https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First&Search_Arg=RE0000296296&Search_Code=REGS Online Copyright Catalog search (form autofilled, pressing "begin search" brings up the entry)]</ref>
*"Briar Rose" is another name given to the character, and appears in the German version of [[the Brothers Grimm]] as ''Dornröschen''.
*Some artists who worked on this film came back to Disney in [[1988]]-[[1989|89]] to work on ''[[Oliver & Company]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'', and ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]''. These artists included Don Selders (Assistant Animator), Eve Fletcher (Ink & Paint Artist), Ann Oliphant (Animation Checking), Darlene Kanagy (Ink & Paint), Gordon Bellamy (Assistant Animator), Tom Ferriter (Assistant Animator), Eleanor Dahlen (Ink and Paint), Sheila Brown (Assistant Animator), and Valentine Vreeland Paul (Ink and Paint Artist).
*Maleficent's curse can be fulfilled at any time before sunset on Aurora's sixteenth birthday.
*Aurora is one of the seven Princesses of Heart in the popular Disney/[[Wikipedia:Square Enix|Squaresoft]] game ''[[Kingdom Hearts (game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', and Maleficent is a villain in all three mainline ''Kingdom Hearts'' games. The good fairies appear in ''Kingdom Hearts II'', giving [[Sora]] new clothes.
*The character of [[Queen Leah|Aurora's mother]], the Queen, has no name credited to her. The only version of the story which gives her a name is a 1993 adaptation by A.L. Singer, in which she is named Queen Leah.
*The cry voiced by [[Lucille La Verne]] as [[The Evil Queen]] in ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' was re-used for Maleficent when her dragon-form is pierced by Prince Phillip's sword.
*Rich Animation Studio's 1994 animated film ''{{WikipediaLink|The Swan Princess}}'' was quite similar to this film. In that film, it also had a princess (in this case named [[w:c:theswanprincess:Odette|Odette]]) being cursed by an evil enchanter (named [https://theswanprincess.fandom.com/wiki/Rothbart Sir Rothbart]), just as  Maleficent cursed Aurora. During the climax  of that film, Odette "dies" temporarily, just as Aurora fell into a deep sleep, and a prince (here named [[w:c:theswanprincess:Prince Derek|Derek]]) saves her by killing Rothbart, who had transformed himself into the "[[w:c:theswanprincess:Great Animal|Great Animal]]," just as Maleficent transformed herself into a dragon and Prince Phillip killed her and saved Aurora with "True Love's Kiss" (as opposed to "Love's First Kiss"). Interestingly, though the story is also based on a Tchaikovsky ballet (''{{WikipediaLink|Swan Lake}}''), the filmmakers decided '''not''' to adapt the ballet score. Instead, they went with a generic '90's pop score by {{WikipediaLink|Lex de Azevedo}}, the score composer for the film and for the first two sequels of the [[Wikipedia:The Swan Princess (film series)|''Swan Princess'' franchise]]; ''{{WikipediaLink|The Swan Princess: Escape from Castle Mountain}}'' and ''{{WikipediaLink|The Swan Princess: The Mystery of the Enchanted Treasure}}''.
*'''Hidden Mickey:''' The biscuits the fairies eat with tea are [[Hidden Mickey|shaped like Mickey Mouse's head and ears]].
*The film was made whilst Walt Disney was building [[Disneyland]] (hence the four-year production time). To help promote the film, Imagineers declared the castle there to be Sleeping Beauty's (it was originally to be Snow White's).
*Second only to [[Dumbo (character)|Dumbo]] (who didn't speak at all), this Disney title character has the fewest lines of actual dialogue throughout the entire film.
**In fact, Aurora and Philip say nothing at all in the film's second half, even after the sleeping spell is lifted.
*The musical score throughout the film was provided by the then Graunke Symphony Orchestra (since [[1990]] called the {{WikipediaLink|Munich Symphony Orchestra}}), under the direction of the score's adapter, [[George Bruns]].
*The particular melody that plays as Phillip and Aurora descend the stairs toward the film's end was a ''branle couppé'' (a short, vigorous country dance) entitled "Cassandre" written by Renaissance composer Thoinot Arbeau, adapted ''ca.'' 1590 as a march in honor of King Henri IV of France, and used as something of a national anthem by French royalists; Tchaikovsky, who had a fondness for national anthems, incorporated it into his ballet score to represent the royal court of "Florestan XIV".
*The complex and detailed background paintings, most of which were done by Frank Armitage and [[Eyvind Earle]], usually took seven to ten times longer to paint than average, which takes about a workday to complete. As opposed to having the backgrounds be designed to match the characters, the film's characters were designed to match the backgrounds.
*The film is the only Disney film with square trees.
*The debate on the setting of this film has been a problem for a long time.
*The moment where Aurora pricks her finger, as well as the fight of Prince Phillip with Maleficent, are referenced in the {{WikipediaLink|Nightwish}} song "Fantasmic", with the lyrics "Maleficent's fury/The spindle so luring/Dragon fight."
*Upon release, the scene where Prince Phillip encounters the dragon was thought too intense for young viewers.
*The original concept for the film began in [[1950]] (after the studio had animated two other princess fairy tales). Work on it was delayed because Walt Disney's attention was turned to the building of Disneyland.
*Walt Disney had originally envisioned the film as his masterpiece.
*On the Blu-ray releases beginning with the 2008 Platinum Edition release, the film is in 2.55:1 widescreen, unlike its previous home video releases (especially the 1997 laserdisc and the 2003 Special Edition DVD which had 2.20:1 widescreen aspect ratio). Showing more picture on the sides.
*Because the film was such a box office disappointment, Disney focused more on live-action films for two years (there were ten before Disney released another animated feature: ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|101 Dalmatians]]''. The style of animation in this one was radically different, possibly because it had been such a failure).
*The film was in the archive for seven years.
*The film appears as one of the transition levels in ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', found in [[Dark Beauty Castle]].
*The film is the first Disney animated classic to have the [[2006]] [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo at the end of current releases.
*The studios have no record as to who provided the voices for the [[Queen Leah|Queen]], nor the [[The Duke|Royal Herald]].
*Barbara Jo Allen (Fauna) was also known as Vera Vague in some of her other films and for her last film role as the [[Scullery Maid]] in ''[[The Sword in the Stone]]''.
*A flamethrower was used to create the dragon breath sound effect for the climax of the film, with training films supplied by the US Army.
*[[Barbara Luddy]] (Merryweather) lent her voice to [[Lady]] in the earlier Disney film, ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]''. After this one, she would also end up being the voices of [[Mother Rabbit]] in ''[[Robin Hood (film)|Robin Hood]]'' and [[Kanga]] in ''[[The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]]'' for her final film.
*[[Eleanor Audley]], (Maleficent), also provided the voice of [[Lady Tremaine]] in ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' nine years earlier.
*Before [[Taylor Holmes]] was chosen as the final voice for King Stefan in the final version of the film, [[Hans Conried]] was considered to voice Stefan as he provided some voice lines for Stefan that can be heard in the demo song called “[[It Happens I Have a Picture]]”, after lending the voices and modeled for both [[Captain Hook]] and [[Mr. Darling]] in ''[[Peter Pan (film)|Peter Pan]]''.
*[[Verna Felton]] (Flora) previously lent her voice to the [[Circus Elephants|Elephant Matriarch]] and [[Mrs. Jumbo]] in ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', the [[Fairy Godmother]] in ''Cinderella'', the [[Queen of Hearts]] in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and [[Aunt Sarah]] in ''Lady and the Tramp''. After this film as Flora, Verna’s last film for Disney and for her acting career was providing the voice for [[Winifred]] in ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.
*Maleficent's horned headdress and bat's-wing-like sleeves, besides being reminiscent of the popular images of horned devils and dragons, reflect actual women's costumes of the fourteenth century.
*The animators couldn't decide what dress color Aurora should wear, so they decided to make it part of the story with the fairies.
*In the opening previews of the 1997 VHS re-released under the [[Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection]] line, there was a commercial for [[Disney's Magic Artist]] on CD-ROM.
*As filmed, the plot bears a remarkable resemblance to that of the novel and lost silent film ''The Goose Girl'' except that there is only one girl involved going by two different names.
*When [[Aurora|Rose]] gets her crown from the fairies, she begins crying still wanting to see [[Prince Phillip]], but it's actually not her crying from her voice actress, it's actually [[Dopey]]'s crying that's reused from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.
*Despite having an underwhelming box office performance, it was the highest grossing animated film of 1959.

==Goofs==
*During Rose's birthday party at the cottage, [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Flora]] tells [[Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather|Merryweather]] to lock the door so that they can secretly use their magic to make everything right for Rose to be surprised, but after Flora and Merryweather's color changing fight when [[Aurora]] gets home, the door is suddenly unlocked as she easily entered inside.
**However, it could have been unlocked off-screen.

==References in other media==
*The film was referenced in Dan Brown's ''{{WikipediaLink|The Da Vinci Code}}'' as an allegory of the Grail quest.
*The music for the film was adapted by Disney's musical director [[George Bruns]] from Tchaikovsky's ballet ''La belle dormant au bois'' (literally, "The Beauty Sleeping in a Wood"), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award.
**The two songs "[[I Wonder]]" and "[[Once Upon a Dream]]" are based on "The Garland Waltz" from Tchaikovsky's ballet. It was also used in recent commercials for {{WikipediaLink|Sargento}} Cheese, as well as a couple of {{WikipediaLink|Fred Quimby}} era {{WikipediaLink|Tom & Jerry}} cartoons.
*The sleeping spell was spoofed on {{WikipediaLink|Hanna-Barbera}}'s ''{{WikipediaLink|The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo}}'' in [[1985]] in which [[Wikipedia:Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] must save {{WikipediaLink|Daphne Blake}} and Princess Esmerelda from this spell caused by Maldor the Malevolent. Interestingly, in the episode from ''{{WikipediaLink|What's New Scooby-Doo?}}'', Daphne wore an outfit similar to one of Aurora's.
