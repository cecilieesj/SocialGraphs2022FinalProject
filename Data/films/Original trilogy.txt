The '''original trilogy''' is the first installment of films of the [[Star Wars saga|''Star Wars'' saga]] to be produced. These were the movies released from [[1977]] to [[1983]]. They primarily focus on the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] trying to free [[the galaxy]] from the clutches of the [[Galactic Empire]], as well as [[Luke Skywalker]]'s quest to become a [[Jedi]] and face Sith Lord [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] and his master [[Darth Sidious]].

The original trilogy is sometimes called the '''classic trilogy''' in contrast to the [[prequel trilogy]]. The [[sequel trilogy]] takes place 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi''.

==Plot summary==
'''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]'''<br />
This film introduces the characters of [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Leia Skywalker Organa Solo|Princess Leia]], as well as the iron-fisted regime of the [[Galactic Empire]]. On [[Tatooine]], Luke's home planet, the exiled Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], in the guise of a kindly old hermit named Ben Kenobi, watches over him. When Luke realizes his Jedi potential, he teams with [[Han Solo]], joins the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebels]], destroys the [[DS-1 Death Star Mobile Battle Station|Death Star]] and rescues Leia from [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. However, this was all possible because of Obi-Wan's sacrifice during his final duel with Vader aboard the Death Star.

'''[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]'''<br />
After the Alliance experiences a [[Battle of Hoth|devastating defeat]] at the hands of the Empire on [[Hoth]], Luke Skywalker goes to receive training from the Jedi Master [[Yoda]] shortly after a visit by Obi-Wan's [[Force spirit]]. However, when Princess Leia and Han Solo are captured by the Empire on [[Bespin]], Luke attempts a rescue only to be confronted by Darth Vader. His battle with the Dark Lord ends in Luke's defeat, and he receives the horrifying revelation that Darth Vader is in fact the former Anakin Skywalker, his father. Leia manages to break free with the help of Han's old friend [[Landonis Balthazar Calrissian|Lando Calrissian]], but Han is himself taken away.

'''[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]'''<br />
After rescuing Han Solo from the gang lord [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]], Luke visits a dying Yoda, who confirms Vader's revelation and reveals that there is another surviving Skywalker before expiring. Obi-Wan Kenobi's spirit appears and elaborates, and Luke deduces that his sister is in fact Leia. While the Alliance engages the Empire in a battle against the [[DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station|second Death Star]] above [[Endor]], Luke confronts Vader and the Emperor [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], the [[Sith]] mastermind who engineered the creation of the Galactic Empire and the fall of Anakin Skywalker. After a brutal duel with Luke, in which he is defeated and shown mercy, Vader renounces the [[dark side of the Force]] and becomes Anakin Skywalker again, destroying Palpatine and saving Luke's life at the cost of his own.

With the destruction of the Death Star and the death of Palpatine, the Empire is defeated. As the Rebels celebrate, Luke sees the smiling spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father.

George Lucas has tinkered repeatedly with the original trilogy. Episodes IV through VI were remastered and re-released
*as [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|Special Editions]] (theatrically, and on VHS and LaserDisc) during [[1997]],
*on [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)|DVD]] in September [[2004]], and
*on [[Star Wars: The Complete Saga|Blu-ray]] in September [[2011]].

The films underwent extensive clean-up and restoration work, and Lucas took advantage of this opportunity to make a number of [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|changes]] and additions of effects. In a [https://web.archive.org/web/20040925053144/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/09/20/film.qa.george.lucas.ap September 2004 interview with CNN], he explains his reasons for the changes:

<blockquote>''To me, the special edition ones are the films I wanted to make. Anybody that makes films knows the film is never finished. It's abandoned or it's ripped out of your hands, and it's thrown into the marketplace, never finished. ... Most artists, most painters, even composers would want to come back and redo their work now. They've got a new perspective on it, they've got more resources, they have better technology, and they can fix or finish the things that were never done.&hellip;''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I wanted to actually finish the film the way it was meant to be when I was originally doing it. At the beginning, people went, "Don't you like it?" I said, "Well, the film only came out to be 25 or 30 percent of what I wanted it to be." ... If you read any interviews for about an eight- or nine-year period there, it was all about how disappointed I was and how unhappy I was and what a dismal experience it was. You know, it's too bad you need to get kind of half a job done and never get to finish it. So this was my chance to finish it.''</blockquote>

The re-release changes are a point of contention among some fans, who claim that they reduce the quality of the movies. Some fans see Lucas' testimony before the U.S. Congress in opposition to colorizing black-and-white films (a position he [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5651949 reiterated] in August 2004) as hypocritical, but the types of alterations Lucas opposes are done by studios without the consent of the artists involved in the original production, as opposed to changes he made to his own films.

On [[May 4]], [[2006]], [[StarWars.com]] announced that the original trilogy would be released in [[Original unaltered trilogy|unaltered form on DVD]] on [[September 12]], 2006.
