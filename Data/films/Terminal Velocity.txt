'''''Terminal Velocity''''' is a [[1994]] action movie starring [[Charlie Sheen]] as a daredevil skydiver who becomes mixed up with [[Russia]]n spies. It was written by David Twohy and directed by Deran Sarafian. Originally, Sheen's role was written for Tom Cruise, although William Baldwin was also considered. The script itself sold for US $500,000. The musical score was composed by Joel McNeely.

==Synopsis==
A Boeing 747 lands in the middle of a desert. A young Russian woman is tortured by getting dunked in the aquarium of her apartment until she drowns dreadfully. Skydiving instructor Richard 'Ditch' Brodie ([[Charlie Sheen]]) takes on a new client, Chris Morrow (Nastassja Kinski), who on her first jump does not open her parachute and apparently dies.

Brodie discovers that Morrow faked her death and that she is really a Russian spy trying to recover a shipment of gold. Brodie uses all of his skydiving skills to outwit the villains and to stay alive.

==Production==
The final stunt – with Sheen at the wheel of a Cadillac Allanté falling to earth – was a mixture of bluescreen and camera work, as a real car was suspended beneath a helicopter and then a reverse zoom made it seem as if it were in free-fall.

Portions of the film were shot in Palm Springs, California.

==Reception==
The film was panned by critics, and currently has a 17% positive scale on Rotten Tomatoes.

The movie debuted at No. 2 at the box office behind ''Timecop''. It eventually made $16,487,349 in ticket sales, making it a box office flop compared to its $50 million budget.
