==Plot==
Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the executive editor in chief of a book publishing company. Her subordinates dislike her because she is pushy and cold. After learning she is about to be deported to Canada because of an expired visa, she convinces her assistant, Andrew Paxton ([[Ryan Reynolds]]), to marry her. Both visit Immigration where an officer, Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare), informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish his book. Margaret agrees.

The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, Andrew's home town, to meet his family. Margaret meets Andrew's mother, Grace ([[Mary Steenburgen]]) and grandmother, Annie a.k.a "Gammy" ([[Betty White]]). During the trip to the family home, Margaret notices that nearly every shop in town carries the name Paxton and learns that Andrew's family is in fact very wealthy. During a welcome home party, Andrew confronts his father, Joe ([[Craig T. Nelson]]), who is angry about Andrew's dating the boss he has so long disliked and thinks he is using her to get ahead in his career. After their argument, Andrew announces the engagement to everyone. Margaret also meets Gertrude (Malin Åkerman), Andrew's ex-girlfriend. After the party is over, Grace and Gammy show Margaret and Andrew the bedroom they will share during the weekend.

The next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a local bar to watch a strip dance by a locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer, Ramone (Oscar Nunez). Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor and make his own life and that Andrew had proposed to Gertrude. However, Gertrude refused because she didn't want to leave Sitka for New York. Returning home, Margaret learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe. That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk. In response, Margaret begins to share personal information about herself with Andrew.

The next day, the family convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. Andrew is stressed, and Margaret tries to comfort him. After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away from town with him. She tells him she has been alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had forgotten what it felt like to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the sham marriage to the entire assemblage, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving his book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out of the house to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she "passes away". Annie admits faking the attack. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. Andrew goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss and then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time.

===Critical reception===
{{Double image|right|Ryan reynolds.jpg|185|Sandra Bullock 2011 AA.jpg|180|Critics praised the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds {{small|(left)}} and Sandra Bullock {{small|(right)}}.}}
''The Proposal'' received mixed reviews. The film has a 44% approval rating on the review aggregator website [[Wikipedia:Rotten Tomatoes|Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 180 reviews with an average rating of 5.3/10, with the consensus: "Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds exhibit plenty of chemistry, but they're let down by ''The Proposal''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s devotion to formula."<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10010458-proposal The Proposal]</ref> Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score, gave the film a 48 out of 100 based on 30 reviews from critics.<ref name="Metacritic">[http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/proposal The Proposal Reviews, Ratings, Credits]</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' gave a mixed review, giving the film three out of four stars despite complaining that the film "recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out".<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090617/REVIEWS/906179989 The Proposal]</ref> Peter Travers of ''Rolling Stone'' was very critical of the film, calling it insipid. He wrote, "Anne Fletcher directs Peter Chiarelli's script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion."<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/8550/51246 The Proposal]</ref> ''New York Times'' writer Manohla Dargis felt that Bullock's character was awkward in comparison to her previous work. She continued: "She’s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel [...] and take the spotlight [...], an independence that persists all the way through the last-act coupling. She can smile as brightly at a man as well as the next leading lady, though, like all genuinely big female stars, she’s really more of a solo act."<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/movies/19proposal.html The Proposal (2009)]</ref> ''The Telegraph''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Tim Robey expressed disappointment towards the film, giving it a two out of five stars.<ref name="Tele">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/5895077/The-Proposal-review.html The Proposal, review]</ref>

{{quote box|width=35%|align=left|quote=It's saying a lot about this section [...] that its comic highlight is Bullock having her mobile phone stolen by a passing eagle, and proffering the family's puppy by way of exchange. In fairness, the leads get very naked before they strictly intend to, and the sound department notches up at least one big laugh with the wettest slap you've ever heard when they unexpectedly collide [...]. But the more recurrent noise towards the end was me groaning with disappointment, that a movie which had struck gold with its central matchmaking was succeeding so ruthlessly in taking the shine off. On the plus side, it's done great business, so we might get to see Bullock and Reynolds back in something soon.|source=— Tim Robey, of ''The Telegraph''<ref name="Tele" />}}
The interaction between Reynolds and Bullock was well received by critics. Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''Entertainment Weekly'' opined that the chemistry between the two actors was "fresh and irresistible."<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20285509,00.html The Proposal Movie Review]</ref> Zorianna Kit of ''The Huffington Post'' exclaimed that "what [kept] audiences of this lite-fare comedy in their seats is the undeniable on-screen chemistry between leads Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds." She continued: "The two are so adept at comedy and have so much fun with one another, viewers watching ''The Proposal'' won't be able to resist their charms, even when some of the plot veers in to unnecessarily silliness."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zorianna-kit/movie-review-the-proposal_b_219057.html Movie Review: The Proposal]</ref> Betsey Sharkley of the ''Los Angeles Times'' felt that their relationship was a "cheeky update of ''The Taming of the Shrew''." She opined, "Bullock's deft physical comedy, one of her most endearing qualities, is given a full run. [...] Reynolds' ability to deliver a line, or a look, with withering, surgical precision is there at every turn."<ref name="LATimes2">[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/19/entertainment/et-proposal19 The Proposal]</ref> Giving it a one out of five stars, ''The Guardian'' writer Peter Bradshaw gave a negative reaction to the interaction between Reynolds and Bullock. Bradshaw stated: "Their initial sparky detestation isn't convincing, and neither is their later thawing and romance. In each scene, it looks as if they have never met before. And Margaret isn't permitted to be a convincing cow, because that would make her unsympathetic [...]. Andrew can't be a total wimp, because that would be unsexy, so the fundamental comic premises of the film are fudged."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jul/24/film-review-the-proposal The Proposal]</ref>
