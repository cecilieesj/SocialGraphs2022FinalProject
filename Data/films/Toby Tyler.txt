'''''Toby Tyler''''' is a [[Disney]] film released on [[January 21]], [[1960]] by [[Buena Vista]] Distribution Company, based on the 1880 children's book of the same name by James Otis Kaler.

==Synopsis==
Overhearing stern Uncle Daniel describe him as a "millstone", [[Toby Tyler (character)|Toby Tyler]] runs away from his foster home to join the circus, where he soon befriends Mr. Stubbs, the frisky chimpanzee. However, the circus isn't all fun and games when the evil candy vendor, Harry Tupper, convinces Toby that Aunt Olive and Uncle Daniel don't love him or want him back. Toby resigns himself to circus life even scoring a much bigger role at the circus. When Toby realizes (with the help of Mr. Stubbs) that Harry lied to him, and that Aunt Olive and Uncle Daniel truly love him, Toby leaves the circus to go home. On the way, however, he finds that Mr. Stubbs has followed him. Deciding to take Mr. Stubbs home with him (to keep him safe,) Mr. Stubbs is chased by a hunter's dog. A hunter named Jim Weaver accidentally shoots him as Harry hauls Toby back to the circus.

Toby discovers Aunt Olive and Uncle Daniel are at the circus, with hugs all around. When Harry tries to pursue Toby, he is caught by Ben Cotter for using the sheriff's money. Ben tells Harry to leave Toby alone and stop acting unkind. Just before Toby's big performance for his family, he discovers Mr. Stubbs is still alive, having been brought back to the circus by Jim. Toby performs on horseback, only to have Mr. Stubbs join him, creating a great new act for the circus.
