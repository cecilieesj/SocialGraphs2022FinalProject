'''''WALL-E''''' (stylized as '''''WALL•E''''') is a [[2008]] American computer-animated romantic science-fiction comedy-drama film produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and directed by [[Andrew Stanton]]. It is Pixar's ninth animated feature film.

The story follows a robot named [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]], who is designed to clean up a waste-covered Earth far in the future. He falls in love with another robot named [[EVE]], who also has a programmed task. The human population, who abandoned Earth for outer space, sent EVE to ascertain if any life still remains on Earth, and WALL-E follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. Both robots exhibit an appearance of free will and emotions similar to humans, which develops further as the film progresses.

After directing ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film largely set in space. Most of the characters do not have real human voices but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds, designed by [[Ben Burtt]], that resemble voices. In addition, it is the first animated feature by Pixar to have segments featuring live-action characters.

[[Walt Disney Pictures]] released it in the United States and Canada on [[June 27]], 2008. The film grossed $23.2 million on its opening day, and $63.1 million during its opening weekend in 3,992 theatres, ranking number one at the box office. This ranks as the fifth highest-grossing opening weekend for a Pixar film. Following Pixar tradition, ''WALL-E'' was paired with a short film, ''[[Presto]]'', for its theatrical release.

''WALL-E'' has been met with overwhelmingly positive reviews among critics, scoring an approval rating of 96% on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. It grossed $521.3 million worldwide, won the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form, the final Nebula Award for Best Script, the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film, and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature as well as being nominated for five other Academy Awards at the 81st Academy Awards. ''WALL-E'' ranks first in ''TIME''<nowiki/>'s "Best Movies of the Decade".

''WALL-E'', besides being entertaining, is also seen as a critique on larger societal issues. This film addresses consumerism, nostalgia, environmental problems, waste management, and the immense impact that humans have on the earth. There is also a rather major overarching theme through this movie, which is issues of human nature, and the direction that the human race is headed. ''WALL-E'' is seen as a movie that appeals to both conservative and liberal audiences.

In 2021, the film was selected to be preserved into the [[National Film Registry]] by the Library of Congress.

==Plot==
Throughout the 21st century, Earth was governed by the [[Buy n Large]] mega-corporation (BnL), causing mass consumerism and covering the planet in dense loads of trash by 2105. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Earth's population was evacuated on fully automated luxury BnL starliners for five years while an army of trash compactor robots called WALL-Es and large city block-wide sized mobile [[incinerator]]s were left behind to clean up the planet.

The plan largely failed, however, forcing humanity to remain in space indefinitely. Seven hundred years later, in 2805, none of the incinerator units are active anymore, the Earth is covered in more trash than ever, creating skyscraper-like towers of trash cubes, and all the WALL-E units powered down, except for [[WALL-E (character)|one]]. This unit has developed sentience and a sense of emotion, particularly curiosity, as shown by his quirky habits of collecting knickknacks from the mountains of trash, and survived by salvaging parts for himself from other defunct WALL-E units. He also owns a pet cockroach named [[Hal]] and lives inside an [[WALL-E Transport Vehicle|old transport truck]]. Usually, he takes a liking to his job, but sometimes he grew a bit lonely and longed for a change than his directive. While watching ''{{WikipediaLink|Hello, Dolly! (film)|Hello, Dolly!}}'', WALL-E realizes that he found the most important missing feature of his life: a girlfriend.
[[File:WALL-E's cooler with some items collected.jpg|thumb|A rubber ducky, a trophy (with the BnL logo on it) and a boot in the cooler.]]

One day, WALL-E finds a seedling plant growing among the trash. He puts it inside an old boot and tries to return it back home, but he gets distracted by a glowing dot in which he follows. Suddenly, WALL-E realizes that the dot was from a landing spaceship. He hides under a hole to prevent getting crushed from it. WALL-E watches as the spaceship deploys a capsule, which pops open and reveals an advanced probe robot named [[EVE]]. WALL-E is instantly mesmerized by EVE, as she carries out her directive of searching for signs of plant life. Initially aloof, hostile, and shooting anything that makes the slightest sound or movement with her laser gun arm, EVE begins to warm up to WALL-E and takes a liking to him.

During a dust storm, WALL-E takes EVE to his truck and shows her his treasure, even the plant, causing her automated systems to store the plant inside her, activating a homing beacon and deactivating her. WALL-E goes to great lengths to try to revive and take care of her, even going on a date with the inactive robot. When her ship returns to collect her, WALL-E desperately clings to the hull of the ship, not wanting to lose his new friend, as it enters space to return to the ''[[Axiom]]'', the flagship of the BnL fleet. Upon docking, WALL-E meets [[M-O]], a tiny cleaning robot, who makes sure the ''Axiom'' is cleaned. WALL-E follows EVE as she is taken to the bridge of the ship by the MVR-A transport robot. As he progresses through the ''Axiom'', it becomes apparent that, after centuries of living in microgravity, relying on the ship's automated systems, and communicating using only their hover chairs' video calling system, the human passengers have suffered severe bone loss, becoming obese and lazy. As WALL-E searches for EVE, he tried asking [[John (WALL-E)|John]] and [[Mary (WALL-E)|Mary]] for assistance, causing them to disconnect from the ship's systems and learn about other activities they're missing out on, such as relaxing in the pool.

[[Captain B. McCrea|The Captain]] himself does little, leaving control of the ship to the autopilot, [[AUTO]]. When EVE is brought to the bridge, the Captain learns through a video that placing her plant sample inside the ship's holo-detector is a sign of Earth being habitable again, causing the ''Axiom'' to enter hyperspace and return to Earth to allow its passengers to repopulate the planet. However, when EVE is opened, the plant is missing. EVE is considered defective and taken to the repair ward along with WALL-E by the MVR-A and [[GO-4]], though the Captain's curiosity is piqued and he begins researching Earth history using dirt samples acquired from shaking hands with WALL-E. At the repair ward, EVE is taken to the testing room, leaving WALL-E, who is considered a reject to the repair robots and taken to a pen among the other rejects, worried. As EVE is being pampered by the robots, WALL-E, only seeing a silhouette of her through a frosted window, believes that she is being harmed and escapes from his pen using his laser to save her. Crashing through the glass, WALL-E grabs EVE's detached arm and threatens to shoot the robots unless they set her free. In a panic, he fires a shot that destroys the control panel, which deactivates the robots and the pens that hold the rejects, causing chaos and accidentally releasing a horde of malfunctioning robots, who carry WALL-E and EVE's arm away, to roam the ship. The alarms raise, causing the Stewards to activate then catch them for a while, taking a picture that labels WALL-E, EVE, and the rejects as "rogue robots" in the process, alarming the entire ship. Annoyed with WALL-E's disruptive influence, EVE attempts to send him back to Earth on an escape pod. However, they see AUTO's assistant, [[GO-4]], deposit the missing plant into the escape pod and set it to self-destruct. WALL-E grabs the plant and tries to return it, but is taken away on the pod, setting him on a panic attack as he tries to figure out how to escape before time runs out. He manages to open the emergency exit and escape before the pod explodes using a fire extinguisher, allowing him to temporarily fly.

WALL-E manages to save the plant, and EVE, joyfully thanking and hugging him, gratefully gives him his very first "kiss" in the form of an electric spark, sending him surprised. The two robots celebrate on a spacewalk around the ''Axiom'' before returning the plant to the Captain. During their trip, Mary notices WALL-E and informs John about him, causing both to meet face-to-face and form a relationship. After returning, the Captain is surprised to find out that EVE recovered the plant. He reviews her visual records of Earth, but it is devastated, leaving him confused. After glancing at the records, he vows to return to Earth and restore the planet. EVE, meanwhile, sees WALL-E's commitment to her well-being while she was inactive and falls in love with him. However, AUTO reveals that he was given a final directive, dated 2110, to keep humanity in space, as Earth had been deemed uninhabitable when he was given the directive. The Captain argues that the plant is proof that life is once again sustainable on Earth, but AUTO and GO-4 stage a mutiny, locking the Captain in his quarters, electrocuting WALL-E, who attempts to fight over the plant, and sending him, EVE, and the plant down a trash chute. Inside there, both get picked up by [[WALL-A]] units, put into huge trash cubes, and were almost sent flying down the airlock disposal thanks to M-O, who preventing the doors from fully closing. EVE tries to search for parts to help the severely damaged WALL-E, but nothing works. Suddenly, EVE realizes that the only parts to repair WALL-E are on Earth, which they can reach quickly if they can activate the hyperjump.

Returning to the ''Axiom'' with M-O, WALL-E calls the rouge robots for help. They then encounter the Stewards again, and the rouge robots help out to defeat them. Meanwhile, the Captain notices that WALL-E and EVE have the plant thanks to another picture taken by the Stewards. Using clever hacking, he informs AUTO that he "acquired" the plant (using an image captured by the projector from EVE's records to trick him), angering him as he tries to find the Captain, starting a fight which causes GO-4 to fall from a window and die. The Captain successfully presses the button that activates the holo-detector during the fight, forcing the ''Axiom'' to go into lockdown. WALL-E, EVE, M-O, and the rouge robots attempt to place the plant in the holo-detector, but AUTO's control of the ship prevents them from doing so. The continuing battle between the Captain and AUTO also made the ship tilt right, making the process more difficult and causing EVE to lose the plant. WALL-E rolls in front of the holo-detector and pushes it upright to lift it, almost stopping AUTO from pressing it down until he shocks the lift button, causing the holo-detector to overpower WALL-E and crush him, upsetting everyone including EVE. Mad by this, the Captain breaks free of his quarters, attempts to walk, and deactivates AUTO, tilting the ship back to normal. M-O manages to find the plant, and, with the help of the robots and the human passengers, successfully activates the holo-detector. EVE comforts the severely damaged WALL-E as the ship activates the hyperdrive and sets its course for Earth.

The ''Axiom'' lands on its dock, destroying the trash cube towers. After the passengers arrive back onto Earth, EVE quickly takes WALL-E back to his truck and successfully repairs him, but his memory and personality appear to have been erased as he reverts to his original trash-compacting duties. Heartbroken, EVE gives him a farewell "kiss", which causes another spark that inadvertently restores WALL-E to his unique personality, happily reuniting the two robots. WALL-E was alive. WALL-E and EVE share a tender moment, holding hands, staring into each other’s eyes, and sharing a tender kiss with no arc of electricity. WALL-E and EVE rejoin the humans and robots as they begin working together to restore Earth, taking care to plant the seedling that brought them back home. The credits reveal that over time, humans and robots worked together to restore the Earth, which return more plants, animals, and structures onto the planet. The humans, having regained their work ethic, also regained their healthy physiques and begin doing other different activities such as jogging and fishing. WALL-E and EVE are shown to still be together, as seen in a painting where they are standing by a tree that's revealed to have been grown from WALL-E's plant.

==Cast and Characters==
*[[Ben Burtt]] produced the voice of [[WALL-E (character)|WALL-E]] (Waste Allocation Load Lifter – Earth-Class), the title character. WALL-E, a robot who has developed sentience, is the only robot of his type shown to be still functioning on Earth. He is a small mobile compactor box with all-terrain treads, three-fingered shovel hands, binocular eyes, and retractable solar cells for power. He collects spare parts for himself, which becomes pivotal to the plot, and replaces broken and/or worn out parts on-the-fly by cannibalizing "dead" WALL-Es. Although working diligently to fulfil his directive to clean up the garbage (all the while accompanied by his cockroach friend Hal and music playing from his onboard recorder) he is distracted by his curiosity, collecting trinkets of interest. He stores and displays these "treasures" such as a birdcage full of rubber ducks, a [[w:c:rubiks:Rubik's Cube (3x3x3)|Rubik's Cube]], Zippo lighters, disposable cups filled with plastic cutlery and a golden trophy at his home where he examines and categorizes his finds while watching video cassettes of musicals via an iPod viewed through a large Fresnel lens.
**[[Ben Burtt]] is also credited for the voice of [[M-O]] (Microbe Obliterator), as well as most of the other robots. M-O is a tiny, obsessive-compulsive maintenance robot with rollers for hands who keeps ''Axiom'' clean. When M-O meets WALL-E and sees how filthy he is, he deviates from his normal routine and follows WALL-E, cleaning up behind him. When he follows WALL-E to the garbage bay, he inadvertently but fortuitously saves WALL-E and EVE from being blown into the vacuum of space. He then forms a close friendship with WALL-E and aids the two in retrieving the plant, most notably through using his contaminant detecting vision when WALL-E drops the plant. Back on Earth, he ushers the other robots into giving WALL-E and EVE some privacy as they share a tender moment.
*[[Elissa Knight]] as [[EVE]] (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a sleek robot probe whose directive is to locate vegetation on Earth and verify habitability. She has a glossy white egg-shaped body and blue LED eyes. She moves using antigravity technology and is equipped with scanners, specimen storage, and a plasma cannon in her arm, which she is quick to use. When first deployed on Earth she appears devoid of feeling but as the craft that delivered her blasts off and away she springs to life with gleeful flight. Watching her, WALL-E accidentally draws her attention as she sets about following her directive growing ever more impatient with both her lack of success and with WALL-E's constant monitoring. This shared strength of feeling soon connects the two characters.
*[[Jeff Garlin]] as [[Captain B. McCrea]], the commander, and apparently only, officer on the ''Axiom''. His duties as captain are boring daily routines, with the ship's autopilot handling all true command functions. Meeting WALL-E, however, sparks his interest in Earth and he becomes engrossed in researching the home planet, paving the way for his retaking control of the ship back from the Autopilot.
*[[Fred Willard]] as [[Shelby Forthright]], historical CEO of the Buy n Large Corporation, shown only in videos recorded around the time of the ''Axiom''<nowiki/>'s initial launch. Constantly optimistic, Forthright proposed the evacuation plans, then to clean up and recolonize the planet. However, the corporation gave up after realizing how toxic Earth had become. Forthright is the only live-action character with a speaking role, the first in any Pixar film.
*MacInTalk, the text-to-speech program for the Apple Macintosh, was used for the voice of [[AUTO]], the rogue autopilot artificial intelligence built into the ship. Unlike other robots in the film, AUTO is not influenced by WALL-E, instead of following directive [[A113]], which is to prevent the ''Axiom'' and the humans from returning to Earth because of the toxicity, and he will prevent anyone from deviating from it. The robot's design is an homage to HAL 9000 from ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', featuring a HAL-style red "eye" in the center of his body.
*[[John Ratzenberger]] and [[Kathy Najimy]] as [[John (WALL-E)|John]] and [[Mary (WALL-E)|Mary]], respectively. John and Mary, living on the ''Axiom'', were so dependent on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings until they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, causing them to form a relationship.
*[[Sigourney Weaver]] as the voice of the ''Axiom''<nowiki/>'s computer. Stanton joked about the role with Weaver, saying, "You realize you get to be 'Mother' now?", referring to the name of the ship's computer in the film ''Alien'', which also starred Weaver.

==Production==
===Writing===
Stanton wrote the screenplay to focus on the visuals and as a guide to what the sound effects needed to convey. Andrew Stanton conceived ''WALL-E'' during a lunch with fellow writers [[John Lasseter]], [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]] in 1994. ''[[Toy Story]]'' was nearing completion and the writers brainstormed ideas for their next projects – ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', and ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' – at this lunch. Stanton asked, "What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot to turn off the last robot?"

Having struggled for many years with making the characters in ''[[Toy Story]]'' appealing, Stanton found his simple ''Robinson Crusoe''-esque idea of a lonely robot on a deserted planet very strong. Stanton made WALL-E a waste collector as the idea was instantly understandable and because it was a low-status menial job that made him sympathetic. Stanton also liked the imagery of stacked cubes of garbage. He did not find the idea dark because having a planet covered in heavy loads of rubbish was for him a childish imagining of disaster.

Stanton and Pete Docter developed the film under the title of ''Trash Planet'' for two months in 1995, but they did not know how to develop the story and Docter chose to direct ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' instead. Stanton came up with the idea of WALL-E finding a plant because his life as the sole inhabitant of a deserted world reminded Stanton of a plant growing among pavements. Before they turned their attention to other projects, Stanton and Lasseter thought about having WALL-E fall in love, as it was the necessary progression away from loneliness.

Stanton started writing ''WALL-E'' again in 2002 while completing ''Finding Nemo''. Stanton formatted his script in a manner reminiscent of Dan O'Bannon's ''Alien''. O'Bannon wrote his script in a manner Stanton found reminded him of ''haiku'', where visual descriptions were done in continuous lines of a few words. Stanton wrote his robot dialogue conventionally but placed them in brackets. In late 2003, Stanton and a few others created a story reel of the first twenty minutes of the film. Lasseter and [[Steve Jobs]] were impressed and officially began development, though Jobs stated he did not like the title, originally spelt "''W.A.L.-E.''"

While the first act of ''WALL-E'' "fell out of the sky" for Stanton, he originally wanted aliens to plant EVE to explore Earth, and the rest of the film was very different. When WALL-E comes to the ''Axiom'', he incites a ''Spartacus''-style rebellion by the robots against the remnants of the human race, which were cruel alien Gels (completely devolved, gelatinous, boneless, legless, see-through, green creatures that resemble gelatin). James Hicks, a physiologist, mentioned to Stanton the concept of atrophy and the effects prolonged weightlessness would have on humans living in space for an inordinately extended time. Therefore, this was the inspiration of the humans degenerating into the alien Gels, and their ancestry would have been revealed in a ''Planet of the Apes''-style ending.

The Gels also spoke a made-up gibberish language, but Stanton scrapped this idea because he thought it would be too complicated for the audience to understand, and they could easily be driven off from the storyline. In ''Captain's Log: The Evolution of Humans'', the Gels had a royal family who host a dance in a castle on a lake in the back of the ship, and the ''Axiom'' curled up into a ball when returning to Earth in this incarnation of the story.

Stanton developed the symbolic theme of the humans learning to stand again and "grow[ing] up", wanting WALL-E and EVE's relationship to inspire humanity because he felt very few films explore how utopian societies come to exist. The process of depicting the descendants of humanity as the way they appear in the movie was very slow. Stanton first decided to put a nose and ears on the Gels so the audience could recognize them. Eventually, fingers, legs, clothes, and other characteristics were added until they arrived at the concept of being fetus-like to allow the audience to see themselves in the characters.

In a later version of the film, AUTO comes to the docking bay to retrieve EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As a homage to ''Get Smart'', AUTO takes the plant and goes into the ship's bowels into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE.

The captain appears unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to be unchallenged; otherwise, he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was initially depicted is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges AUTO. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the ''Axiom''.

Originally, EVE would have been electrocuted by AUTO and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the [[WALL-A]] robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening. He wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, which made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Despite this change, the original idea made its way onto the [[WALL-E (video game)|video game]], and scenes of it appeared in trailers.

Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the short film ''[[Your Friend the Rat]]'', created an end credits animation that continued the story – and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history – to clarify an optimistic tone.

===Design===
''WALL-E'' was the most complex Pixar production since ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' because of the world and the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, ''WALL-E'' required 125,000. Production designer [[Ralph Eggleston]] wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, while the second act on the ''Axiom'' to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the ''Axiom'' environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage.

Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look vaster. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be very large, otherwise, they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E – who was made yellow to emulate a tractor – would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.

Stanton also wanted the lighting to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He felt Pixar had captured the physics of being underwater with ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', so for ''WALL-E'', he wanted to push that for air. It was while rewatching some of his favourite science fiction films he realized Pixar's films lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks.

Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test consisted of building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70 mm camera, and then trying to replicate that on the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.

Stanton wanted the ''Axiom''<nowiki/>'s interior to resemble Shanghai and Dubai. Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings and the original concept art for [[Tomorrowland]] for the ''Axiom'', to reflect that era's sense of optimism. Stanton remarked "We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [at Pixar] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland," and wanted a "jetpack" feel. Pixar also studied the [[Disney Cruise Line]] and visited Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting. Eggleston based his ''Axiom'' designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava. Eggleston divided the inside of the ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic grey concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue and white of the BnL logo.

The coach class with living/shopping spaces has 'S' shapes as people are always looking for "what's around the corner". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large Zen-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooden quarters and the sleek dark bridge. In keeping with the artificial ''Axiom'', camera movements were modelled after those of the Steadicam.

The use of live action was a stepping stone for [[Pixar]], as Stanton was planning to make ''John Carter of Mars'' his next project. Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant they had to make the rest of the film look even more realistic. Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricatured, then the audience would not have recognized how serious their devolution was. Stanton cast [[Fred Willard]] as the historical Buy n Large CEO because "He's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of." The CEO says "stay the course," which Stanton used because he thought it was funny. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] did the visual effects for these shots.

===Animation===
''WALL-E'' went undeveloped during the 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not confident enough yet to have a feature length film with a main character that behaved like [[Luxo Jr.]] or [[R2-D2]]. Stanton explained there are two types of robots in cinema: "human[s] with metal skin", like the Tin Man, or "machine[s] with function" like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea "powerful" because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do with babies and pets: "You're compelled ... you almost can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'" He added, "We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life."

The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery, and also met robot designers, visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, watched a recording of a Mars rover, and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human.

Stanton wanted WALL-E to be a box and EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's eyes were inspired by a pair of binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox back in 2003 (during the production of ''Finding Nemo''). He "missed the entire inning" because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. [[Ralph Eggleston]] noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body.

His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked very flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from ''Short Circuit'' until others pointed it out to him.

Stanton wanted EVE to be at the higher end of technology and asked iPod designer Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature.

AUTO was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', and the usage of ''Also Sprach Zarathustra'' for the showdown between the captain and AUTO furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, AUTO was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms, and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.

To animate their robots, the film's story crew and animation crew watched a Keaton and a [[Charlie Chaplin]] film every day for almost a year, and occasionally a Harold Lloyd picture. Afterwards, the filmmakers knew all emotions could be conveyed silently. Stanton cited Keaton's "great stone face" as giving them perseverance in animating a character with an unchanging expression. As he rewatched these, Stanton felt that filmmakers – since the advent of sound – relied on dialogue too much to convey exposition. The filmmakers dubbed the cockroach WALL-E keeps as a pet "Hal", in reference to silent film producer Hal Roach (as well as being an additional reference to HAL 9000). They also watched ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', ''The Black Stallion'', and ''Never Cry Wolf'', films that had sound but were not reliant on dialogue. Stanton acknowledged ''Silent Running'' as an influence because its silent robots were a forerunner to the likes of R2-D2, and that the "hopeless romantic" Woody Allen also inspired WALL-E.

===Sound===
Producer Jim Morris recommended Ben Burtt as sound designer for ''WALL-E'' because Stanton kept using [[R2-D2]] as the benchmark for the robots. Burtt had completed ''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' and told his wife he would no longer work on films with robots but found ''WALL-E'' and its substitution of voices with sound "fresh and exciting". He recorded 2500 sounds for the film, which was twice the average number for a ''[[Star Wars]]'' film, and a record in his career. Burtt began work in 2005 and experimented with filtering his voice for two years. Burtt described the robot voices as "like a toddler [...] universal language of intonation. 'Oh', 'Hm?', 'Huh!', you know?"

During production, Burtt had the opportunity to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on ''WALL-E''. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically-accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic if unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.

Burtt saw a hand-cranked electrical generator while watching ''Island in the Sky'', and bought an identical, unpacked device from 1950 on eBay to use for WALL-E moving around. Burtt also used an automobile self-starter for when WALL-E goes fast, and the sound of cars being wrecked at a demolition derby provided for WALL-E's compressing trash in his body. The Macintosh computer chime was used to signify when WALL-E has fully recharged his battery. For EVE, Burtt wanted her humming to have a musical quality. Burtt was only able to provide neutral or masculine voices, so Pixar employee Elissa Knight was asked to provide her voice for Burtt to electronically modify. Stanton deemed the sound effect good enough to properly cast her in the role. Burtt recorded a flying radio-controlled jet plane for EVE's flying, and for her plasma cannon, Burtt hit a [[slinky]] hung from a ladder with a timpani stick. He described it as a "cousin" to the blaster noise from ''Star Wars''.

MacInTalk was used because Stanton "wanted AUTO to be the epitome of a robot, cold, zeros & ones, calculating, and soulless [and] Stephen Hawking's kind of voice I thought was perfect." Additional sounds for the character were meant to give him a clockwork feel, to show he is always thinking and calculating.

Burtt had visited Niagara Falls in 1987 and used his recordings from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm, though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around the parking lot and then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.

===Music===
Thomas Newman re-collaborated with Stanton on ''WALL-E'' since the two got along well on ''Nemo'', which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, in the hope that starting this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged for the first time in October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up of many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the ''Axiom'', and used electronics too.

Stanton originally wanted to juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music, but he saw ''The Triplets of Belleville'' (2003) and did not want to appear as if he were copying it. Stanton then thought about the song "[[Put On Your Sunday Clothes]]" from ''Hello, Dolly!'', since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production. Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love, which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. Jim Reardon suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included "[[It Only Takes a Moment]]" and the clip of the actors holding hands because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. ''Hello Dolly!'' composer Jerry Herman allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story "genius". Coincidentally, Newman's uncle Lionel worked on ''Hello, Dolly!''

Newman traveled to [[London]] to compose the end credits song "Down to Earth" with Peter Gabriel, who was one of Stanton's favorite musicians. Afterward, Newman rescored some of the film to include the song's composition, so it would not sound intrusive when played. [[Louis Armstrong]]'s rendition of "La Vie en rose" was used for a montage where WALL-E does not get EVE's attention on Earth. The script also specified using Bing Crosby's "Stardust" for when the two robots dance around the ''Axiom'', but Newman asked if he could score the scene himself. A similar switch occurred for the sequence in which WALL-E attempts to wake EVE up through various means; originally, the montage would play with the instrumental version of "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head", but Newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for the sequence.

==Themes==
This movie is widely recognized as a critique on our society. It brings up very real issues that the world, and especially densely populated areas, are dealing with today and even more so in the future. Katherine Ellison asserts that “Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of solid waste per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study.” Landfills are filling up so quickly that the UK may run out of landfill space by the year 2017.

===Environment and Waste===
Because WALL-E overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's production values and aesthetic, without being too obvious.

In “WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental nostalgia,” Robin Murray and Joseph Heuman explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artefacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, i.e. Zippo lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth.

Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste-filled Earth while playing “Put on Your Sunday Clothes,” reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the site and feel of soil and the plant brought back to the spaceship by EVE, that makes the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on heterosexual romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.

Stanton describes the theme of the film as "irrational love defeats life's programming":

<blockquote>I realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was ... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built ... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines, and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people. of dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.</blockquote>

===Technology===
Stanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because "that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet". Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the ''Axiom'' has separated them from nature, making them "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human".

Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant, and during the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. "''WALL-E'' is not a Luddite film," he said. "It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature – that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along."

===Christianity===
Stanton, who is Christian, named EVE after the Biblical character because WALL-E's loneliness reminded him of Adam before God created his wife. Dreher noted EVE's biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and move away from the "false god" of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers. Dreher also noted this departure from classical Christian viewpoints, where Adam is ''cursed'' to labor, in that ''WALL-E'' argues hard work is what makes humans human.

Dreher emphasized the false god parallels to BnL in a scene where a robot teaches infants "B is for Buy n Large, your very best friend", which he compared to modern corporations such as McDonald's creating brand loyalty in children. Megan Basham of ''World'' magazine felt the film criticizes the pursuit of leisure, whereas WALL-E in his stewardship learns to truly appreciate God's creation.

During writing, a Pixar employee noted to Jim Reardon that EVE was reminiscent of the dove with the olive branch from the story of Noah's Ark, and the story was reworked with EVE finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage. WALL-E himself has been compared to [[Prometheus]], Sisyphus, and Butades: in an essay discussing WALL-E as representative of the artistic strive of Pixar itself, Hrag Vartanian compared WALL-E to Butades in a scene where the robot expresses his love for EVE by making a sculpture of her from spare parts.

"The Ancient Greek tradition associates the birth of art with a Corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover's shadow traces it on the wall before he departed for war. The myth reminds us that art was born out of longing and often means more for the creator than the muse. In the same way, Stanton and his Pixar team have told us a deeply personal story about their love of cinema and their vision for animation through the prism of all types of relationships."

==Reception==
===Release ===
Continuing a Pixar tradition, ''WALL-E'' was paired with a short film for its theatrical release, ''Presto''. The film was dedicated to Justin Wright (1981–2008), a Pixar animator who had worked on ''Ratatouille'' and died of a heart attack before ''WALL-E'' release.

[[Walt Disney Imagineering]] (WDI) built animatronic WALL-Es to promote the picture, which made appearances at [[Disneyland Resort]]; the Franklin Institute; the Miami Science Museum; the Seattle Center; and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318 kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed to know exactly what they were required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout.

Very small quantities of merchandise were sold for ''WALL-E'', as ''[[Cars]]'' items were still popular, and many manufacturers were more interested in ''Speed Racer'', which was a successful line despite the film's failure at the box office. Thinkway, which created the ''WALL-E'' toys, had previously made ''[[Toy Story]]'' dolls when other toy producers had not shown an interest. Among Thinkway's items were a WALL-E that danced when connected to a music player, a toy that could be taken apart and reassembled, and a groundbreaking remote control toy of him and EVE that had motion sensors that allowed them to interact with players. There were even plushies. The "Ultimate WALL-E" figures were not in stores until the film's home release in November 2008, at a retail price of almost $200, leading ''The Patriot-News'' to deem it an item for "hard-core fans and collectors only".

===Box-office performance===
''WALL-E'' grossed $223,808,164 in the USA and Canada and $297,503,696 overseas for a worldwide total of $521,311,860, marking it the ninth highest grossing film of 2008.

The film premiered at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on June 23, 2008.

In the USA and [[Canada]], it opened in 3,992 theatres on June 27, 2008. During its opening weekend, it topped the box office with $63,087,526 which is currently the fifth-best opening weekend for a Pixar film and the fourth-best opening among films released in June. The movie earned $94.7 million in its first week and crossed the $200 million mark during its sixth weekend.

Countries where it grossed over $10 million are the following: [[Japan]] ($44,005,222), [[UK]], [[Ireland]] and Malta ($41,215,600), [[France]] and the Maghreb region ($27,984,103), [[Germany]] ($24,130,400), [[Mexico]] ($17,679,805), [[Spain]] ($14,973,097), [[Australia]] ($14,165,390), [[Italy]] ($12,210,993), and [[Russia]] and the CIS ($11,694,482).

===Home media ===

The film was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on [[Disney DVD|DVD]] and [[Disney Blu-ray|Blu-ray]] Disc on November 18, 2008. The various editions included ''Presto'', a new short film ''[[BURN-E]]'', the Leslie Iwerks documentary film ''The Pixar Story'', shorts about the history of Buy n Large, the behind-the-scenes special features and a Digital Copy of the film that can be played through iTunes or Windows Media and compatible devices. It sold 9,042,054 DVD units ($142,633,974) in total becoming the second best-selling animated DVD among those released in 2008 in terms of units sold (behind ''Kung Fu Panda''), the best-selling animated feature in terms of sales revenue and the 3rd best-selling among all 2008 DVDs. ''WALL•E'' was re-released in a 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack on July 5, [[2011]]. The re-release includes all special features available on the previous 3-disc release.

In 2022, Wall-E became the first Pixar film to be featured in [[The Criterion Collection]], with a planned release on November 22. Besides including a 4K Blu-Ray disc, the release ports many of the 3-disc release's extras as well as Andrew Stanton's 1987 student film ''A Story'', and new featurettes exploring Stanton's influences and a feature called ''Wall-E: A to Z''.<ref>https://www.criterion.com/films/33246-wall-e</ref>

===Reviews===
''WALL-E'' was met with critical acclaim from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 95% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 244 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. At ''Metacritic'', which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 95, based on 39 reviews, which represents "universal acclaim". indieWire named ''WALL-E'' the third best film of the year, based on their annual survey of 100 film critics, while Movie City News shows that ''WALL-E'' appeared in 162 different top ten lists, out of 286 different critics lists surveyed, the most mentions on a top ten list of any film released in 2008.

Richard Corliss of ''Time'' named ''WALL-E'' as his favorite film of 2008 (and later of the decade), noting the film succeeded in "connect[ing] with a huge audience" despite the main characters' lack of speech and "emotional signifiers like a mouth, eyebrows, shoulders [and] elbows". It "evoke[d] the splendour of the movie past" and he also compared WALL-E and EVE's relationship to the chemistry of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Other critics who named ''WALL-E'' as their favorite film of 2008 included Tom Charity of CNN, Michael Phillips of the ''Chicago Tribune'', Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''Entertainment Weekly'', A. O. Scott of ''The New York Times'', Christopher Orr of ''The New Republic'', Ty Burr and Wesley Morris of ''The Boston Globe'', Joe Morgenstern of ''The Wall Street Journal'', and Anthony Lane of ''The New Yorker''.

Todd McCarthy of ''Variety'' called the film "Pixar's ninth consecutive wonder", saying it was imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that the main difference between the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism. Kirk Honeycutt of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' declared that ''WALL-E'' surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the "heart, soul, spirit and romance" of the best silent films. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings. He praised Burtt's sound design, saying "If there is such a thing as an aural sleight of hand, this is it."

Roger Ebert writing in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' found ''WALL-E'' "an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment, and a decent science-fiction story". Ebert said the scarcity of dialogue would allow it to "cross language barriers" in a manner appropriate to the global theme, and noted it would appeal to adults and children. He praised the animation, saying the color palette was "bright and cheerful [...] and a little bit realistic", and that Pixar managed to generate a "curious" regard for the WALL-E, comparing his "rusty and hard-working and plucky" design favorably to more obvious attempts at creating "lovable" lead characters. He said ''WALL-E'' was concerned with ideas rather than spectacle, saying it would trigger stimulating "little thoughts for the younger viewers." He named it as one of his twenty favorite films of 2008 and argued it was "the best science-fiction movie in years".

The film was interpreted as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy said it did so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the ''New York Post'' wrote that by depicting future humans as "a flabby mass of pea-brained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", ''WALL-E'' was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney's Parks and Resorts]], adding, "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers."

Maura Judkis of ''U.S. News & World Report'' questioned whether this depiction of "frighteningly obese humans" would resonate with children and make them prefer to "play outside rather than in front of the computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to ''National Review Online'' including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a "fascinating" and occasionally "brilliant" production).

A few notable critics have argued that the film is vastly overrated, claiming it failed to "live up to such blinding, high-wattage enthusiasm", and that there were "chasms of boredom watching it", in particular, "the second and third acts spiralled into the expected". Other labels included "preachy" and "too long".

Child reviews sent into CBBC were mixed, some citing boredom and an inadequate storyline.

Patrick J. Ford of ''The American Conservative'' said ''WALL-E''<nowiki/>'s conservative critics missed lessons in the film that he felt appealed to traditional conservatism. He argued that the mass consumerism in the film was not shown to be a product of big business but of too close a tie between big business and big government: "The government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed, and this lack of variety led to Earth's downfall."

Responding to Coffin's claim that the film points out the evils of mankind, Ford argued the only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch with our own humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as the farm, the family unit, and wholesome entertainment were in the end held aloft by the human characters. He concluded, "By steering conservative families away from ''WALL-E'', these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice."

Director Terry Gilliam praised the film as "A stunning bit of work. The scenes on what was left of planet Earth are just so beautiful: one of the great silent movies. And the most stunning artwork! It says more about ecology and society than any live-action film – all the people on their loungers floating around, brilliant stuff. Their social comment was so smart and right on the button."

==Accolades==
''WALL-E'' won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing at the 81st Academy Awards, which it lost to ''Slumdog Millionaire'', ''The Dark Knight'' and ''Milk'', respectively. Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination, but it was not nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted ''WALL-E'' to the Best Animated Feature category.

Peter Travers commented that "If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E." Only three animated films, 1991's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and Pixar's next two films, 2009's ''[[Up]]'' and 2010's ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film was restricted to the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception, and eventually "The line [between live-action and animation] is just getting so blurry that I think with each proceeding year, it's going to be tougher and tougher to say what's an animated movie and what's not an animated movie."

''WALL-E'' made a healthy appearance at the various 2008 end-of-the-year awards circles, particularly in the Best Picture category, where animated films are often overlooked. It has won the award, or the equivalent of it, from the Boston Society of Film Critics (tied with ''Slumdog Millionaire''), the Chicago Film Critics Association, the Central Ohio Film Critics awards, the Online Film Critics Society, and most notably the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, where it became the first animated feature to win the prestigious award. It was named as one of 2008's ten best films by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.

It won Best Animated Feature Film at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, 81st Academy Awards, and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2008. It was nominated for several awards at the 2009 Annie Awards, including Best Feature Film, Animated Effects, Character Animation, Direction, Production design, Storyboarding, and Voice acting (for Ben Burtt); but was beaten out by ''Kung Fu Panda'' in every category. It won Best Animated Feature at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards and was also nominated there for Best Music and Sound.

Thomas Newman and Peter Gabriel won two Grammy Awards for "Down to Earth" and "Define Dancing". It won all three awards it was nominated for by the Visual Effects Society: Best Animation, Best Character Animation (for WALL-E and EVE in the truck) and Best Effects in the Animated Motion Picture categories. It became the first animated film to win Best Editing for a Comedy or Musical from the American Cinema Editors. In 2009, Stanton, Reardon, and Docter won Nebula Award, beating ''The Dark Knight'' and the ''Stargate Atlantis'' episode "The Shrine". It won Best Animated Film and was nominated for Best Director at the Saturn Awards.

At the British National Movie Awards, which is voted for by the public, it won Best Family Film. It was also voted Best Feature Film at the British Academy Children's Awards. WALL-E was listed at #63 on ''Empire''<nowiki/>'s online poll of the 100 greatest movie characters, conducted in 2008.

**Though the first teaser (which featured the origin of the idea of the film) uses the original logo.
*The book ''Disney Trivia from the Vault: Secrets Revealed and Questions Answered'' by [[Dave Smith]] (who is also known to have his own column in the very first ''Disney Magazine'' called 'Ask Dave', or the most recent [[Disney D23|D23]] web site) mentions [[A113]]'s appearances on both [[AUTO]]'s override directive and the license plate on [[Mrs. Davis]]' minivan in ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', stating that the code is the room number of the animation classroom at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] where some of the Pixar students studied.
*At the end of the original theatrical release, a normal Pixar logo (the first feature to have the "Animation Studios" text appear late) is seen. However, the home video release features a unique variant where WALL-E appears and fixes [[Luxo, Jr. (character)|Luxo, Jr.]]'s burnt lightbulb, which appeared in a trailer for the movie beforehand.
*This, along with ''Toy Story'' and ''Finding Nemo'', are the only three Pixar films not to have any actual villains, since AUTO's and GO-4's "villainy" were primarily due to the way they were both programmed, and they both don't have any other choice.
*According to the first teaser trailer, [[Andrew Stanton]] and other creators had lunch at the Hidden City Café in the summer of [[1994]], [[Toy Story]] was almost complete, and Stanton interviews, "Geez, if we're going to make another movie, we got to get started now." Among these work-in-progress films that began almost immediately are ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', and eventually, this film.
*This is the first [[Pixar]] film to have a character walk into said logo, followed by ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.
*This is Pixar's last original film so far to receive a G rating from the MPAA.
*This is Pixar's second original film and the second post-Disney purchase Pixar film to be released in the summer.
*This is Pixar's first science-fiction film, followed by ''[[Lightyear]]''.
