'''''The Castaway Cowboy''''' is a [[1974]] American adventure film released by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Productions]] starring [[James Garner]], Vera Miles, Eric Shea, and Robert Culp about a Texas rancher who gets shanghaied, then jumps ship and finds himself washed ashore in [[Hawaii]]. Filmed on location in Hawaii, the movie was directed by [[Vincent McEveety]] and written by Don Tait and Richard M. Bluel.

==Plot==
Texas cowboy, Lincoln Costain ([[James Garner]]), gets "shanghaied" in San Francisco, then jumps ship and washes ashore on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, right into the arms of widow Henrietta MacAvoy (Vera Miles) and her son (Eric Shea) who are struggling to make a living as farmers. A lot of wild cattle often trample their crops, so Costain gets the idea to start cattle ranching instead. The Hawaiian farm hands don't readily take to the American cowboy culture, and Calvin Bryson (Robert Culp), is a banker with eyes to grab Henrietta's land and maybe Henrietta herself.
