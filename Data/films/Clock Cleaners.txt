'''''Clock Cleaners''''' is a color ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' animated short. It was released in [[1937]].

==Synopsis==
Mickey, [[Donald Duck|Donald]], and [[Goofy]] each face different obstacles while cleaning a giant clock tower. Mickey tries to remove a sleepy stork that is nesting in the gears while the main spring causes trouble for Donald. Later, a conk on the head by a mechanical bell ringer causes Goofy (who mistook it for an actual person) to dazedly stumble along a high ledge and through a perilous trek, while Mickey does his best to make sure his pal doesn't take a nasty fall.

==Censorship and Controversy==
[[File:Clock Cleaners - Donald.png|thumb|250px|Donald arguing with the main spring]]
During the 1990s, Donald Wildmon and the American Family Association forced Walmart to discontinue the sale of the VHS tape ''Walt Disney Cartoon Classics: Fun on the Job'', which contained this short. The reason for this was that during his argument with the main spring, Donald Duck allegedly shouts curse words at the spring (he actually says "Says who?" and calls the spring a "snake in the grass"). These were misinterpreted as profanity by some people due to Donald's unintelligible "duck voice" provided by [[Clarence Nash]]. It should be noted that Disney would not have been allowed to release the cartoon in theaters if such foul language were actually used; the Hays Code was heavily enforced since 1934 and would have prevented Disney from doing so.

Due to this controversy, when the cartoon was included on the ''Walt Disney Treasures'' DVD set ''Mickey Mouse in Living Color'', Donald's line was replaced with the line, "Awww, nuts!", taken from ''[[On Ice]]'' (the edit is made obvious because the viewer can hear [[Pluto]] barking when Donald says this), and the "snake in the grass" line was also redubbed with Donald's angry gibberish. This same edit also occurs on the DVD release of ''[[The Great Mouse Detective]]'' (which includes the cartoon as a bonus feature), the ''Funny Factory with Goofy'' DVD, and the ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' Collector's Edition bonus DVD, and was also present when the short was broadcast as part of ''[[Treasures from the Disney Vault]]'' on Turner Classic Movies.

However, the scene was shown with its original dialogue in the TV special ''One Hour in Wonderland'', which is included as a bonus feature on the ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]: Masterpiece Edition'' DVD. Additionally, the ''[[Have a Laugh!]]'' broadcasts of the cartoon on the [[Disney Channel]] and the ''[[Have a Laugh!#DVD releases|Have a Laugh!: Volume 2]]'' DVD have reinstated the original line (though a different title card was made for this release). More recently, on [[Disney+]]'s version of the cartoon, Donald's "Says who?" line is altered, and the "snake in the grass" line was still replaced with Donald's angry gibberish.

==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
*Donald initially starting to wash the mainspring, but gets entangled in it.
*Mickey's entire struggle with the stork.
*Donald's argument with the mainspring.
*Part of Donald's body swaying in a ticking sound.
*The first time the Lady Liberty bell ringer rings the bell and the second time the Father Time ringer rings it.
