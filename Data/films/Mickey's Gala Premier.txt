==Trivia==
*On September 1, 1939, ''“Mickey’s Gala Premier”'' was the final program broadcast by the BBC Television Service (today's BBC One) before it ceased broadcasting during World War II.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060712053209/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff.php The edit that rewrote history]</ref> An urban legend about this final broadcast claims that due to the sudden outbreak of the war the BBC cut the cartoon short, even before it was properly ended. Despite this widespread belief, the cartoon was actually shown in its entirety and then followed by an announcement of later scheduled programming (which was never shown) and tuning signals. On June 7, 1946, the day BBC television broadcasts resumed after the war, ''Mickey’s Gala Premiere'' was shown again.
*The cartoon ''“Gallopin’ Romance”'' was made exclusively for ''Mickey’s Gala Premiere''. There is no separate Mickey Mouse cartoon with that title. However, both the title and the design of [[Pete]]'s costume used in ''Gallopin' Romance'' resemble the true cartoon “''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]''”.
*[[Ed Wynn]] would later play [[The Mad Hatter]] in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' ([[1951]]) and [[Uncle Albert]] in ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' ([[1964]]), among other roles in other Disney films.
*[[Maurice Chevalier]] would later sing the theme song of the Disney animated film, ''[[The Aristocats]] ''([[1970]]), as well as appear in the live-action Disney film, ''[[In Search of the Castaways]] ''([[1962]]). He would go on to be named a Disney Legend, an award given to those who have made an outstanding contribution to The Walt Disney Company.
*[[Helen Hayes]] would later play [[Mrs. Steinmetz]] in the Disney film, ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]''.
*Both Jimmy Durante and the comedy duo of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy would share an appearance with Mickey in the MGM 1934 film ''[[Hollywood Party]]'', with Durante even interacting with Mickey in the mouse's key scene.
*Younger viewers often misidentify Will H. Hays to be Prince Charles{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, since Hays wears a royal robe and crown and has a long nose and large ears, identical to the way Prince Charles is often caricatured. However, Prince Charles was born in 1948, almost 15 years after this cartoon was made.
*This was the first time Mickey interacts with humans.
*The opening and closing song, [[Congratulations, Mr. Mickey Mouse]] in this cartoon were heard in the [[1988]] Disneyland cavalcade show, ''Mickey's 60th Birthday Bash''.
*At this point in time, the Mickey shorts were released through [[United Artists]], but the only currently existing prints of this short are reissue prints that omit any mention of UA. However, the "titles" for the short-within-a-short ''“Gallopin’ Romance”'' still exist in their original form with the UA credits. This gives today's viewer an idea on what an opening of a Mickey Mouse cartoon might have looked like in the UA era.
