'''''Out Cold''''' is a [[2001]] American comedy film about a group of snowboarders in [[Alaska]]. It is the first feature film by the music video directing team The Malloys, after co-directing the surfing documentary ''Thicker Than Water'' ([[2000]]) with musician Jack Johnson. The film presents itself as a parody of [[1980]]s "ski school" movies and makes a number of references to the film ''Casablanca''. A number of elements of the latter, including plot and famous lines, were incorporated into ''Out Cold''.

==Plot==
The story covers the lives of snowboarding buddies Rick, Luke, Anthony, and Pig Pen, who are living large in their beloved hometown of Bull Mountain in Alaska. Partying hard, looking for girls, and doing just about anything to have a good time is what life on Bull Mountain is all about, but that all looks to have a quick end when town founder Papa Muntz dies, and his son Ted decides to sell the mountain to slick Colorado businessman John Majors. Nobody supports his plans to turn the mountain into an "espresso-and-tofu" ski resort, and it's up to Luke, Pig Pen, Anthony, Jenny, Rick and the others to keep Bull Mountain yuppie-free. Once they realize John's purchase will change the town drastically, they enlist the aid of Majors' beautiful, rebellious daughters, Inga and Anna, to sabotage the purchase.
