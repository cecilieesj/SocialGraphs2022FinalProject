'''''Susie the Little Blue Coupe''''' is an animated short that was released originally theatrically on [[June 6]], [[1952]]. The eight-minute short was directed by [[Clyde Geronimi]] and based on an original short-story by [[Bill Peet]]. The story was adapted for the screen by Bill Peet and Don DaGradi.

The film's method of anthropomorphizing the cars, using the windshield for the eyes and eyelids, served as a stylistic inspiration for character design for [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' franchise.

The DVD release of ''[[The Love Bug]]'' featured this short as a special feature. ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' DVD also features the short as a bonus episode on the DVD's trivia section.

==Synopsis==
[[Susie the Little Blue Coupe (character)|Susie]] is a small blue coupe on display in a dealer showroom who is bought by a well-to-do man who is taken with her. Thrust into high-society, she finds herself surrounded by much larger, more luxurious cars but eventually makes do. She is pampered, but time takes its toll on her, mechanically and cosmetically; eventually, her owner trades her in. A second man buys her but her new life is much less pampered, being left outside in the cold and being poorly maintained. One night, she is stolen, chased by the police and totaled in the resulting wreck. Rotting in a junkyard, all looks hopeless for Susie when a young man notices her, buys her, and with the help of his friends, completely restores and revives her into a brand new hotrod.
