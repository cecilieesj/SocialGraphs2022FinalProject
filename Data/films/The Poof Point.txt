'''''The Poof Point''''' is a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]], based on the book of the same name by Ellen Weiss and M. Friedman.

== Plot ==
Two scientists invent a time machine. A critical part (the "vector modulator") falls out of it before they get into it to test it. Nothing seems to happen at first, but when they wake up the next day they are regressing in age (mentally, not physically). Their kids, Eddie and Marie, seem to notice something strange is going on, judging by their behavior. Soon enough, the kids realize that it is the machine that has changed them. They gradually get younger and the kids notice that the fish that their parents were experimenting on earlier seemed to just disappear after growing younger in a "poof" of sorts. The point at which something ceases to exist thus becomes known as the "poof point". The kids know they have to get their parents in the machine and reverse the effect some way before they, too, just "poof" away.
