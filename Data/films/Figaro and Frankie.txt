'''''Figaro and Frankie''''' is a [[1947]] short film starring [[Figaro]].

==Synopsis==
Figaro is paired with [[Frankie the Canary|Frankie]], a canary who likes to sing. Only the singing is getting on Figaro’s nerves since he would like to have a cat nap.

Figaro shakes Frankie up in his cage and Frankie spits seeds at Figaro. The two squabble like this until Figaro makes a concerted effort to get up to Frankie’s cage.

Frankie then whistles an alarm which brings [[Minnie Mouse|Minnie]] running. She scolds Figaro and threatens him with her broom. Frankie then shoots more seeds at Figaro, who has had enough. Figaro manages to get up to Frankie’s cage and, despite Frankie's ''second'' alarm, knocks the whole thing over, alerting Minnie again. She is shocked when she finds Figaro inside the cage with feathers in his mouth and no Frankie in sight. Thinking Figaro ''killed'' Frankie, she makes good on her threat and Figaro is chased with the broom from the house and told never to come back, as Minnie tearfully realizes she'll never see Frankie again.

What she doesn't know is that Frankie is alive and well, and decides to fly the coop to join the free birds he sees in the sky. Only problem is, Frankie’s wings are out of practice. In the meantime a bulldog appears in the yard and Figaro scrambles up to the window sill to escape him. Frankie finds himself caught between a vengeful Figaro and an angry bulldog and even Figaro’s angel of goodness has a hard time convincing him to save the canary. In the end Figaro does save Frankie and Minnie is happy, although Figaro still has to listen to Frankie's singing as Minnie does warn him not to touch ''or'' harm the bird again.

==Trivia==
* This cartoon was released the same month and year as the ''Looney Tunes'' short film "Tweetie Pie" from rival studio Warner Bros., which was the first cartoon to debut another cat-and-canary rivalry, Sylvester and Tweety, even though both ''Looney Tunes'' characters previously debuted without each other in 1945 and 1942 respectively.
**Co-incidentally that same year, Warner Bros. ''Looney Tunes'' also had similarly-named canary from this cartoon named Frankie (albeit completely unrelated to Disney's version used in this cartoon) who only appeared in the cartoon "Catch as Cats Can". Co-incidentally, both 1947 ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons <nowiki>''</nowiki>Tweetie Pie" and "Catch as Cats Can" co-star Sylvester (who co-incidentally is also a black-and-white cat much like Disney's Figaro).
*This is the only cartoon that Butch Bulldog doesn't co-star with [[Pluto]], and the only Minnie Mouse/Figaro cartoon to feature Butch.
