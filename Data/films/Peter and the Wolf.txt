'''''Peter and the Wolf''''' is an animated short of the segment in ''[[Make Mine Music]]''. It was released in [[1946]] and produced by [[Walt Disney]], with [[Sterling Holloway]] providing the voice of the narrator. It was reissued as a stand-alone short on [[September 14]], [[1955]].

==Synopsis==
The musical tale of [[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]], a small Russian boy who goes out to hunt a [[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|wolf]], and almost bites off more than he can chew!

==Characters==
Each character is represented by a corresponding instrument in the music:
*[[Peter (Make Mine Music)|Peter]] (string quartet)
*[[Sasha]] (flute)
*[[Sonia]] (oboe)
*[[Ivan]] (clarinet)
*[[Peter's grandfather]] (bassoon)
*[[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir]] (timpani and woodwinds)
*[[Wolf (Make Mine Music)|Wolf]] (French horn)

This version makes several changes to the original story, for example:
*During the character introduction, Peter's animal friends are given names: "Sasha" the bird, "Sonia" the duck, and "Ivan" the cat.
*As the short begins, Peter and his animals friends already know there is a wolf nearby and are preparing to catch him.
*The [[Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir|hunters]] get names at a later point in the story: "Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir".
*Peter daydreams of hunting and catching the wolf and exits his cabin carrying a wooden "popgun" rifle with the purpose of hunting the wolf down.
*At the end, in a complete reversal of the original (and to make the story more child-friendly), it turns out that Sonia has ''not'' been eaten by the wolf. (He is shown chasing her, who hides in a tree's trunk. He attacks out of view, then returns in view with some of her feathers in his mouth and licking his jaws. Peter, Ivan, and Sasha assume he has eaten her. After he has been caught, Sasha is shown mourning over Sonia. She comes out of the tree trunk at that point, and they are happily reunited.)

This version of ''Peter and the Wolf'' was featured in ''[[House of Mouse]]'', and characters from it appeared in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and an audio recording of it with expanded narration by Sterling Holloway was released on [[Disneyland Records]] (DQ-1242). On one of his television programs, Disney recalled how Prokofiev himself visited the Disney studio, eventually inspiring the making of this version. Disney used an actor to recreate how the composer sat at a piano and played the themes from the score.

==Voice Cast==
*[[Sterling Holloway]] - Narrator
*[[Pinto Colvig]] - Vocal Effects
*[[Jimmy MacDonald]] - Vocal Effects

==Trivia==
*The opening scene of the story and a part of the wolf's first scene were used for the "[[Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow]]" montage in the ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs]]'' volume ''[[Very Merry Christmas Songs]]''.
