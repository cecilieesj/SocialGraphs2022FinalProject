'''''Simon Birch''''' is a [[1998]] Technicolor American comedy-drama film loosely based on ''A Prayer for Owen Meany'' by John Irving. It was directed and written for the screen by [[Mark Steven Johnson]]. The film stars Ian Michael Smith, [[Joseph Mazzello]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Oliver Platt]], and [[Jim Carrey]]. It omitted much of the latter half of the novel and altered the ending. The movie does not share the book's title at Irving's request; he did not believe that this novel could successfully be made into a film. The name "Simon Birch" was suggested by him to replace that of Owen Meany. The main plot centers around 12-year old Joe Wenteworth and his best friend Simon Birch.

==Cast==
