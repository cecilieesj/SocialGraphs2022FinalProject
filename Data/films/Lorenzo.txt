The short is also known as ''Lorenzo's Tail''.

It was produced for the unfinished third Fantasia film and was finally released in home formats in [[2015]] as part of the ''Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection''.

==Summary==
[[Lorenzo (character)|Lorenzo]] is a vain narcissistic cat living in a restaurant, lazing about on a couch near the window and eating shrimp cocktails. After feigning sympathy towards less fortunate strays watching him through the window, a stub-tailed black cat named [[Molly (Lorenzo)|Molly]] walks by the restaurant. Lorenzo laughs at her lack of a tail while lovingly dancing with his own luxuriously fluffy one. Molly then places a curse on Lorenzo's tail, bringing it to life. After dancing with his very domineering tail, Lorenzo tries to kill it and make it inanimate again, trying and failing through various methods. Molly reappears with a knife, beckoning him to just chop it off. He hesitates, but takes the knife, only for his tail to grab it and try killing him. After hiding behind a door, Lorenzo is able to grab the knife and cut it off. Molly, Lorenzo, and his tail happily reappear and take their bows.

==Behind the Scenes==
''Lorenzo'' was initially conceived by [[Disney Legends|Disney Legend]] [[Joe Grant]] as a short based around tango music, with several sketches being re-discovered around the same time as the production of ''[[Destino]]''. [[Mike Gabriel]] picked up the project and sought out different tango pieces to use as a base track, buying numerous CDs, though quickly falling in love with and using one of the earliest tracks he listened to, an arrangement of Osvaldo Pugliese's ''Bordoneo y 900'' by Juan Jose Mosalini and his Big Tango Orchestra.
