{{Quote|The adventure of a lifetime.|Tagline}}

'''''Toy Story 4''''' is a [[2019]] American computer-animated comedy film produced by [[Pixar Animation Studios]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. As the fourth installment in Pixar's ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' series and the sequel to the [[2010]] film, ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', the film was directed by [[Josh Cooley]] and released in theaters on [[June 21]], [[2019]].

The film continues from ''Toy Story 3'', where [[Woody|Sheriff Woody]], [[Buzz Lightyear]] and their friends have found new appreciation among their other toy friends after being given by [[Andy Davis|Andy]] to [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]. When Bonnie makes a new toy named [[Forky]] out of trash, she takes him and the rest of her toys on an RV road trip. During their trip, Forky gets lost and Woody and Buzz head out to find him and end up reuniting with [[Bo Peep|an old friend]].

After its premiere, ''Toy Story 4'' was theatrically released in the [[United States]] on June 21, 2019 in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, and IMAX. The film was critically acclaimed, with critics praising its story, humor, emotion, animation, and vocal performances. The film was also a box office success, grossing $1.073 billion worldwide, making it at the time the 30th highest-grossing film of all time, the fourth highest-grossing animated film of all time (behind ''[[Frozen]]'', ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' and ''Minions''). It is currently the 33rd highest-grossing film of all time and the fifth highest-grossing animated film of all time (behind ''[[Frozen II]]'', ''Frozen'', ''Incredibles 2'', and ''Minions'').

The film even won several awards including an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and is nominated for Best Original Song for "[[I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away]]".

==Synopsis==
[[Woody]] and the rest of the toys are back for an all-new adventure in ''Toy Story 4'', welcoming new friends to Bonnie's room, including a reluctant new toy called Forky. "Like most people, I assumed that ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' was the end of the story", said director [[Josh Cooley]]. "And it was the end of Woody's story with Andy. But just like in life, every ending is a new beginning. Woody now being in a new room, with new toys, and a new kid, was something we have never seen before. The questions of what that would be like became the beginning of an entertaining story worth exploring."

But Forky insists that he is NOT a toy! An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he doesn't belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he tries to get away, someone yanks him back into an adventure he'd rather skip. "The world of Toy Story is built upon the idea that everything in the world has a purpose", said Cooley. "A toy's purpose is to be there for its child. But what about toys that are made out of other objects? Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable spork, so he's facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him."

==Plot==
Nine years ago, between the events of the [[Toy Story 2|second]] and [[Toy Story 3|third]] films, [[RC Car|R.C.]] is being swept down a storm drain after [[Andy Davis|Andy]] forgets to bring him inside before the storm. [[Woody]] and the other toys mount a successful rescue operation, but while they are busy, a friend of [[Mrs. Davis|Andy’s mother]] arrives and buys [[Bo Peep]] and her lamp; despite Woody's efforts to prevent the sale, Bo reassures him that it is part of being a toy to be taken away.

Two years after Andy donated his toys to Bonnie, Woody and the other toys are content in their new life. Worried that Bonnie will feel overwhelmed at her kindergarten orientation, Woody – who Bonnie has been neglecting – sneaks into her backpack, and his fears come to light. But after a male classmate bullies Bonnie, Woody covertly places a spork and other items from a trash can on Bonnie’s table during arts and crafts, and she turns them into a handmade toy-spork she names “Forky”. After Bonnie places Forky in her backpack, he comes to life, which scares Woody.

Woody introduces him to the rest of Bonnie’s toys, Forky experiences an existential crisis, believing he was made to be trash and not a toy, and the other toys prevent him from throwing himself away. On a road trip with Bonnie’s family and her toys, Forky – still believing himself to be trash – jumps out of the window, prompting Woody to go after him. Woody convinces Forky of the joys of being a toy, and they journey to the RV park in a nearby town where Bonnie and her parents will be staying.

Reaching the town, Woody spots Bo’s lamp at an antique store. Searching for Bo inside, he and Forky encounter a doll named Gabby Gabby and her sycophant ventriloquist puppets, the Bensons. Gabby Gabby offers to take them to Bo, but soon reveals her true colors and plan: To obtain Woody’s voice box since her own is broken and no child will purchase her. Woody and Forky try to escape, but Forky is captured by the Bensons. By the time Woody escapes the shop, he realizes that he has left Forky behind. Woody reunites with Bo, who has become a nomad adventurer helping lost toys find owners. With Bo’s companion, a diminutive toy cop named Giggle McDimples, they take a route through a nearby carnival to rescue Forky from the antique store.

Meanwhile, Buzz searches for Woody on his own, seeking guidance in the button-induced phrases from his own voice box. Buzz finds himself as a prize in a carnival booth and escapes with plush toys Ducky and Bunny. Buzz finds Woody and Bo, and they recruit Ducky and Bunny to help rescue Forky, promising they will become Bonnie’s toys, along with Bo’s old friend from the antique store, Duke Caboom, a Canadian stuntman toy.

At the antique store, the toys’ plan to rescue Forky fails. Woody, the only toy still determined to save Forky, has a falling out with the other toys and indirectly insults Bo. As Bo, Duke, Giggle, Ducky, and Bunny return to the carnival, Woody gives up his voice box to Gabby Gabby in exchange for Forky. Gabby Gabby is desperate to be adopted by Margaret (the store owner)’s granddaughter, Harmony, but Harmony is not interested in Gabby Gabby and rejects her, leaving her disappointed, and offers Woody his voice box back, but Woody insists she keeps it. Buzz returns to Bonnie’s RV and cries out to retrieve Bonnie’s backpack, which she left at the antique store. Woody comforts Gabby Gabby and Bo, and her gang return after a change of heart.

After Bonnie returns for her backpack, the toys follow her and her parents. Buzz and Forky make it back to Bonnie through Duke’s motorcycle skills, who is delighted to have Forky back. Taking Woody’s advice, Gabby Gabby sees a lost little girl crying, giving her comfort, and is finally found by her parents. Ducky, Bunny, Giggle, and Duke Caboom say goodbye to Woody and leave. As Woody and Bo say goodbye, Woody becomes hesitant to return with Bonnie. With some encouragement from Buzz, Woody decides to stay with Bo and help lost toys find owners. Buzz and the gang give Woody and Bo a goodbye hug, and the two groups go their separate ways. The RV’s engine starts, and the toys head into Bonnie’s RV while her parents start the engine and head home. Rex asks if Woody will be a lost toy, and Buzz says that he will never be one. Buzz and Woody share one last message to each other from afar, “To infinity...and beyond.” Woody and Bo Peep spend their night living together by looking at the nice carnival view and the night sky.

After Woody and Bo travel with the carnival in the mid-credits scenes, one year has passed, and Bonnie entered first grade. At a newly built pier, Ducky and Bunny do one more version of their “plush rush” and spread laser eyes and superpowers, which Duke Caboom asks if they really can. At Bonnie’s room, mirroring the scene where Woody introduces Forky, Jessie brings home a new friend Bonnie created: Karen Beverly, a decorated plastic knife. Instantly smitten, Forky offers to shepherd her in her journey through life as a toy instead of trash. When her first question is “How am I alive?” he is stumped, and all he could say was “I don’t know”.

In the post-credits scene, Duke Caboom successfully jumps onto the ‘I’ of the Pixar logo, poses, and gives the winter Combat Carl a long-awaited high five, ending the movie.

==Development==
[[Lee Unkrich]] has said in many interviews that Pixar currently does not have any plans to make a ''Toy Story 4'', and that the purpose of ''Toy Story 3'' was to bring the story of the toys and their relationship with [[Andy Davis|Andy]] to a phenomenal end. He thinks it's great that people want to see another ''Toy Story'' film, but Pixar will for now focus on other stories. He has said however that Pixar will try to find various ways to keep the characters alive, as seen in the ''[[Toy Story Toons]]'' series and ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]'' and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]'' that there may be a ''Toy Story 4'' in the future, but they don't have any plans for it right now. In July 2010, [[Tim Allen]] signed on to reprise his role for a fourth feature-length film, but this did not necessarily mean that a ''Toy Story 4'' was in development. It could have easily been just in case they ever thought of a good idea for a fourth film that they would have the voice of Buzz on board. However, it did show that Disney and Pixar were toying with the idea of another ''Toy Story'' film. [[Tom Hanks]] who was supposed to turn 62 when ''Toy Story 4'' was released had also signed on to reprise his role in case the film was made. In June 2011, Tom Hanks said in an interview that "I think they're working on it right now." However, [[John Lasseter]] says, "We haven't announced anything, so I can't really talk about it." In February 2013, several sites reported that a ''Toy Story 4'' was in production with a release date in 2015. Some sites claimed that Disney and Pixar had confirmed ''Toy Story 4'', but Disney has since denied these rumors saying "Nothing is official". In the most recent Muppet film, ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'', [[Gonzo]] mentions (during the "[[We're Doing a Sequel]]" number) that Disney is waiting for Tom Hanks to be available so they can make a ''Toy Story 4''.

Despite [[Don Rickles]]' passing in [[2017]], it had been officially confirmed he would reprise his role as Mr. Potato Head using pieces of dialogue that Rickles had previously recorded as in the film, provided that his estate gave permission for the film to do so.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 451 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Heartwarming, funny, and beautifully animated, ''Toy Story 4'' manages the unlikely feat of extending – and perhaps concluding – a practically perfect animated saga."

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, and 89% of those at PostTrak gave it a positive score, with 75% saying they would definitely recommend it.

==Music==
{{Main|Toy Story 4 (soundtrack)}}
The film score of ''Toy Story 4'' was composed and conducted by [[Randy Newman]], his ninth for Pixar after ''Toy Story'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''Toy Story 2'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''Cars'', ''Toy Story 3'', ''[[Monsters University]]'', and ''[[Cars 3]]''. On June 21, 2019, [[Walt Disney Records]] released the ''Toy Story 4'' soundtrack for digital download.

In addition to the tracks included in the soundtrack album, the official release also includes "[[I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away]]" by Randy Newman, "[[The Ballad of the Lonesome Cowboy]]" by [[Chris Stapleton]], and Newman's original version of "[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]".

==Possible Sequel==
In February 2019, Allen expressed interest in doing another film as he "did not see any reason why they would not do it". That May, producer Mark Nielsen confirmed that after ''Toy Story 4'', Pixar would return its focus to making original films instead of sequels for a while. On ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show'', Hanks said that ''Toy Story 4'' would be the final installment in the franchise, but Nielsen disclosed a possibility of a fifth film, as Pixar was not ruling out that possibility. There is no official announcement on the fifth installment.

==Trivia==
*''Toy Story 4'' is the first film of the franchise to be shot in the 2.39:1 aspect ratio, unlike the first three films which were produced in 1.85:1 in addition to the first time a Pixar franchise has become a tetralogy.
**The reason for this change is because the main cast are going beyond Tri-County as director Josh Cooley and producer Jonas Rivera stated during an interview. This change was done to accommodate the fact that Woody's world had opened up once he reunites with Bo Peep.
*''Toy Story 4'' is the first Pixar film not to be accompanied by a short [[Pixar]] film since the original ''[[Toy Story]]'' (not counting ''[[Coco (film)|Coco]]'''s later theatrical releases in which originally had the ''[[Frozen]]'' featurette ''[[Olaf's Frozen Adventure]]'' before the main feature).
**Since [[John Lasseter]]'s departure, [[SparkShorts]] created by the new talents of Pixar have succeeded the traditional line of Pixar shorts as they were scheduled to be sent straight to [[Disney+]] by late 2019.
*''Toy Story 4'' is the final Pixar film with John Lasseter's involvement before his leave from Pixar and Disney Animation at the end of 2018 leaving Pete Docter in charge.
**This fact would, therefore, make ''Toy Story 4'' the first Pixar film released under [[Pete Docter]]'s supervision, who succeeded him as CEO after Lasseter's leave.
*''Toy Story 4'' is the third [[Pixar]] film to have its own variant of the Pixar logo, after ''[[WALL-E (film)|WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', with the opening Pixar logo transitioning into the film as it has Luxo, Jr. glowing in the rain during the flashback scene and the closing logo have [[Duke Caboom]] replace Luxo, Jr. in the logo.

*This is the second fourth film in a computer-animated film series to feature Kristen Schaal after the 2010 DreamWorks film ''Shrek Forever After''.
*''Toy Story 4'' is the first film of the franchise fully featuring [[Bonnie Anderson|Bonnie]]'s dad, Mr. Anderson, though he is seen from the backside doing yardwork alongside his wife at the end of the third film.
*''Toy Story 4'' is the third Pixar film to have two producers after ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]''.
*[[Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear|Lotso]] appears on stage during the D23 Expo for ''Toy Story 4 but'' did not appear in the film.
*Madeline McGraw replaces Emily Hahn as Bonnie due to the latter being too old to reprise her role in the film.
*As with ''Toy Story 3'', which ended [[Andy Davis]]’ saga as one of the main supporting characters, ''Toy Story 4'' ends Woody’s saga as the main character and thus, most likely the franchise as a whole.
*At the very end of the credits, there is a dedication to [[Don Rickles]], the voice of Mr. Potato Head who died of kidney failure in April 2017, and another one to Adam Burke, a Pixar animator who passed away of brain cancer in October 2018. Both of them died the two years ''Toy Story 4'' was originally going to be released. Before it was given the 2019 release date, ''Toy Story 4'' was set to be released in 2017, the year Rickles died. It was later delayed to 2018, the year Burke died.
*''Toy Story 4'' is also the final [[Pixar]] film to feature the involvement of [[Lee Unkrich]] who left Pixar in 2019 to which he is credited as the Executive Producer.

*When the first full trailer was released, Disney fans from the Middle Eastern countries launched a huge campaign on Twitter with the hashtag ''#احنا_مش_مجرد_لعبة'' (literally meaning ''#WeAreNotAToy'') that became an instant trend in several countries, asking Disney to dub the movie into Egyptian Arabic, as Disney used to dub all their movies to Egyptian Arabic since 1975, before unfortunately stopping in early 2012.
**As a side note, the original ''Toy Story'' trilogy is considered as the most popular and loved Disney owned franchises in the Middle East, next to ''[[The Lion King]]'', with all three movies dubbed in Egyptian Arabic the same years they were released.

*To date, this is the only G-rated film in history where LGBT characters are present; two married moms are shown twice in the background during the kindergarten scene. That may partially explain the film being designated a TV-PG rating on FX broadcasts.
*Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head and Hamm have far less screen time in this movie compared to all the screen time they got in the first three films.
*The eighth animated sequel to be produced in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, unlike the previous installments which were produced at 1.85:1, after ''[[wikipedia:Rugrats Go Wild|Rugrats Go Wild]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Shrek Forever After|Shrek Forever After]]'', ''[[w:c:bstudios:Ice Age: Continental Drift|Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', ''[[Planes: Fire & Rescue]]'', ''[[w:c:bstudios:Ice Age: Collision Course|Ice Age: Collision Course]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Despicable Me 3|Despicable Me 3]]'', and ''[[wikipedia:Sherlock Gnomes|Sherlock Gnomes]]''.
