'''''The Fox and the Hound 2''''' is a [[2006]] direct-to-video midquel to the [[1981]] [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated feature film, ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]''. It was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]] and released on [[December 12]], 2006. The story of the film takes place during the youth of [[Tod]] and [[Copper]], between the event in which [[Amos Slade]] threatens to blast Tod, and the event in which Copper leaves Tod for the hunting trip ahead. The film had an official soundtrack album released on [[November 21]], 2006.

The film features the voice talents of Reba McEntire, Patrick Swayze, Jonah Bobo, Harrison Fahn, Jeff Foxworthy, Vicki Lawrence, and Stephen Root. It is directed by Jim Kammerud, who had previously directed ''[[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea]]'' and ''[[101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure]]'' and screenplay writer Roger S. H. Schulman's previous films were ''Balto'', ''Shrek'', ''[[The Jungle Book 2]]'' and ''[[Mulan II]]''.

==Plot==
Best friends Tod the red fox (Jonah Bobo) and Copper the hound dog (Harrison Fahn), back as teenage pups from [[The Fox and the Hound|the first film]], visit a country fair in Nashville, [[Tennessee]] when they see a band of dogs called "The Singin' Strays". The band has five members: [[Dixie]] (Reba McEntire), Cash (Patrick Swayze), Granny Rose (Vicki Lawrence), and twin brothers Waylon and Floyd (both [[Jim Cummings]]). Their band leader is Lyle Snodgrass (Jeff Foxworthy). It is important that they perform well because a talent scout from the Grand Ole Opry (Stephen Root) will be at the fair. Cash and Dixie get into an argument, and Dixie walks off before their performance, forcing them to go on stage without her. During the show Copper sings along, and Cash invites the pup up on stage to sing with them. The musical number is a success. Cash invites Copper to join the band, which he does upon promising that he is a "stray". Copper spends the entire day with Cash, forgetting his promise to watch fireworks with Tod.

Dixie finds Tod and sympathizes with his feelings of abandonment. During their conversation, Tod lets it slip that Copper isn't a stray, and Dixie hatches a plan to get Copper out of the band with Tod's help. Tod lures Copper's owner, [[Amos Slade]] ([[Jeff Bennett]]), and Slade's other dog [[Chief]] ([[Rob Paulsen]]) to the fair in a wild chase. The chase leads to widespread mayhem in the fair, and the Singin' Strays' performance is sabotaged right in front of the talent scout Mr. Bickerstaff. Copper is fired from the band and returns home with Slade. Tod is sorry for ruining everything and is brought home by [[Widow Tweed]] ([[Russi Taylor]]). Along the way, Tweed narrowly misses being hit by the talent scout's car, and Bickerstaff's hat flies off and lands on Tod. The following day, Tod and Copper admit their mistakes and are friends again. Hoping to amend for his doings, Tod gives Bickerstaff's hat to Copper, who uses it to track down the talent scout at a local diner.

Tod tricks Cash and Dixie into thinking the other is in trouble, and the entire band ends up meeting up at the diner. Copper convinces the band of the importance of harmony, and The Singin' Strays howl a reprise of their song "We're in Harmony", attracting the attention of the talent scout. Impressed with the band, he arranges for the dogs to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. The film ends with Copper choosing to leave the band and play with Tod again.

==Production==
In the film, the goal of the Singin' Strays is to get on the Grand Ole Opry, Nashville. Disney worked with many popular country artists and the Country Music Television cable network to promote this film.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117943931.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1&query=%22The+fox+and+the+hound+II%22] ''Reference CMT and Reba McEntire as Dixie''</ref> Big Mama, Vixey (due to the fact that Tod meets her at his adult ages in the [[The Fox and the Hound|first film]]), Dinky, Boomer, and Squeaks the caterpillar didn't make a reappearance in this film. Amos Slade is a [[wikipedia:comic relief|comic relief]] character here, without the darker side portrayed in the first film. Chief appears but has very few speaking parts and very little screen time.

== Reception ==
''The Fox and the Hound 2'' is not well-liked compared to the original 1981 predecessor.

It falls somewhere in the middle of the Disney DVD sequel spectrum."

John J. Puccio of Movie Metropolis gave the film 4/10, writing "Like most sequels, it's a pale imitation of the original."

==Trivia==
*This is the last film to have the 1990 variant of [[Walt Disney Pictures logo]] in theatrical releases.
