{{Quote|Every saga has a beginning&hellip;|Tagline|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
'''''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace''''' is a [[1999]] film written and directed by [[George Lucas]], produced by [[Rick McCallum]] and starring [[Liam Neeson]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Jake Lloyd]], and [[Ian McDiarmid]]. It is the first chapter of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[prequel trilogy]], the fourth theatrical ''Star Wars'' release overall, and chronologically the first film in the [[Star Wars saga|''Star Wars'' saga]].

''The Phantom Menace'' was released in theaters on [[May 19]], 1999, becoming the first ''Star Wars'' film since [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], which was released sixteen years earlier. The release was accompanied by extensive media coverage and great fan anticipation. Despite mixed reviews from critics and fans, the film grossed $924.3 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing ''Star Wars'' film when unadjusted for inflation. It was re-released on Blu-ray in [[September]] [[2011]], and was re-released in theaters in 3D on [[February 10]], [[2012]].

The film was the catalyst for fifteen years of ''Star Wars'' storytelling that would primarily take place around the time of the prequel storyline. The success of the film allowed for the next two chapters of the prequel trilogy, as well as the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars|television series]].

[[File:Dioxis.png|thumb|left|250px|Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan prepare to fight their way out of the Trade Federation flagship.]]
Thirty-two years before the events of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], there is a trade dispute between the [[Trade Federation]] and the outlying systems of the [[Galactic Republic]], which has led to a [[Invasion of Naboo|blockade]] of the Mid-Rim [[planet]] of [[Naboo]]. [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]], leader of the [[Galactic Senate]], has secretly dispatched two [[Jedi]], [[Jedi Master|Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to serve as "the ambassadors" to the Federation [[flagship]], in order to meet with [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] and resolve the dispute. Unknown to them, the Trade Federation is in league with the mysterious [[Darth Sidious]], [[Dark Lord of the Sith]], who secretly orders Gunray to [[Invasion of Naboo|invade Naboo]] and kill the two Jedi upon their arrival. When Gunray asked if that would be legal, Sidious says that he would ensure that it was.

The Viceroy locks the Jedi in the meeting room and attempts to kill them with [[poison gas]] while having their ship, the ''[[Radiant VII]]'', destroyed in the hangar, but they escape. After [[Escape from the Saak'ak|battling]] through squads of battle droids, Jinn and Kenobi make their way to the command deck where Gunray is located, shielding himself behind [[blast door]]s. The Jedi are forced to flee upon the arrival of two [[Droideka|Destroyer Droids]] and stow away aboard two separate [[C-9979 landing craft|Federation landing craft]] leaving for the surface of [[Naboo]] to begin the invasion.

Back in the command deck, [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala|Amidala]] contacts Gunray to express her disapproval of their blockade, with Gunray explaining that they wouldn't have done it without the approval of the Senate. When she asks about the ambassadors sent by the Chancellor, Gunray claims that they have received no such ambassadors, leaving Amidala startled and suspicious. Gunray ends communications with her and informs his aide that they should disable all communications on the planet.

Meanwhile, Amidala is conversing with Senator [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] regarding the recent attempt at negotiations and how Gunray claimed that they did not receive any ambassadors. Surprised, Palpatine states that he had assurances from the Chancellor that his ambassadors did arrive. However, Palpatine is unable to finish his sentence as his [[hologram]] flickers out. Naboo Governor [[Sio Bibble]] suspects that the interruption of communications is a sign that an invasion from the Trade Federation is imminent.

[[File:TPM_Cast.png|250px|thumb|The Jedi liberate the queen and her guards from the battle-droid invasion.]]
On the planet's surface, Qui-Gon saves native outcast [[Jar Jar Binks]] from being crushed by a Trade Federation [[Multi-Troop Transport|MTT]]. Kenobi appears, pursued by [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform|STAPs]], which are destroyed by Qui-Gon. Jar Jar Binks shows the two Jedi the way to an underwater [[Gungan]] settlement, [[Otoh Gunga]]. Meanwhile, the Trade Federation occupies [[Theed]], the capital city of Naboo, and captures Queen Amidala along with the rest of the government. In Otoh Gunga, the Jedi meet the Gungan leader, [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass|Nass]], and ask him to help the people of Naboo, but Nass refuses and sends them off in a [[Gungan bongo submarine|bongo submarine]]. They are attacked by an [[opee sea killer]] and a [[colo claw fish]] but both fish are eaten by a [[sando aqua monster]]. The Jedi, with Binks in tow, arrive in Theed and rescue Queen Amidala. They depart for [[Coruscant]], the Galactic Republic's capital planet, to ask for help from the Senate. As they attempt to run the blockade, the [[Naboo Royal Starship|queen's starship]] is damaged by [[Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighter|Federation battleships]], but an [[astromech droid]] named [[R2-D2]] manages to repair it and they narrowly escape.

Due to the damage to the ship's [[hyperdrive]] sustained in the attack, the Jedi decide to land on the nearby planet [[Tatooine]] instead of proceeding to Coruscant. While searching for a new hyperdrive generator, they befriend young [[Anakin Skywalker]], a slave boy, whose master is [[Watto]], a [[Toydarian]] junk dealer. Watto has the required parts in stock, but Qui-Gon is unable to purchase them, as [[Galactic Credit Standard|Republic credits]] are worthless on Tatooine.

[[File:Anakin_Pod.png|thumb|left|250px|Anakin races ahead of Sebulba during the Boonta Eve Podrace.]]
Anakin is gifted with piloting and mechanical abilities, and has built an almost-complete droid named [[C-3PO]]. Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of [[the Force]] in Anakin, and feels that he may be the [[Chosen One]]&mdash;the one who will fulfill a prophecy by bringing balance to the Force. By entering Anakin into a [[Podracing|podrace]], Qui-Gon orchestrates a gamble in which the boy (alone, since Qui-Gon was unable to include the [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|youth's mother]] in the bargain) will be released from slavery while also acquiring the parts needed for their ship. The night before the race, Qui-Gon does a blood test on Anakin and discovers that the boy's [[midi-chlorian]] reading is off the chart.

Anakin wins the race (defeating his rival, [[Sebulba]]) and joins the team as they prepare to leave for Coruscant, where Qui-Gon plans to seek permission from the [[Jedi High Council]] to train Anakin to be a Jedi. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious sends his apprentice, [[Maul|Darth Maul]], to kill the two Jedi and capture the queen. Maul appears just as the group is leaving the planet, and [[Duel on Tatooine|duels]] with Qui-Gon. The fight is cut short when Qui-Gon escapes his black-robed assailant by jumping on board the Naboo Royal Starship as it takes off.

[[File:Amidalabeforesenate.jpg|thumb|250px|Amidala and Palpatine plead before the Senate to intervene with Naboo's crisis.]]
On Coruscant, Qui-Gon informs the Jedi Council of the mysterious attacker he encountered on Tatooine, coming to the conclusion that his attacker is a [[Sith]], the latter being a religious order who were followers of the [[dark side of the Force]] [[Jedi-Sith War|and thought to have been extinct]] for over a millennium, much to the shock of the Jedi Council. Qui-Gon also informs the Council about Anakin, hoping that he can be trained as a Jedi. After testing the boy and deliberating with one another, the Council refuses, deeming him too old for training according to the [[Jedi Code]]. They are also concerned that they sense much fear in the boy, and that he has a clouded future.

Meanwhile, [[Senator]] Palpatine meets with Queen Amidala to warn of corruption in the Senate and advises that she may have to call for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. When their petition to the Senate is refused, Amidala sees no alternative but to do just that. Palpatine is among the candidates to become the new Supreme Chancellor. The queen later announces to Palpatine that she will return to their home planet to repel the invasion of her people by herself. She is frustrated by the Senate's deliberation and lack of action, and feels that even if Palpatine is elected Chancellor, it will be too late. The Jedi Council sends the two Jedi to accompany the queen back to Naboo, hoping to shed light on any Sith involvement.

[[File:Nass_on_Sacred_Place.png|thumb|left|250px|Boss Nass at the Gungan Sacred Place]]
Amidala, back on Naboo, attempts to locate the Gungans at Otoh Gunga, but Jar-Jar, after searching the city, informs them that it has been abandoned. He then leads them to the [[Gungan Sacred Place]], where he is certain the Gungans [[Boss Meetup|will be]]. The Gungans are initially distrustful, until the "handmaiden" Padmé reveals herself as the true queen and humbly begs for their help. She negotiates with Boss Nass to form an alliance and unite their peoples in battle against the Trade Federation. Captain Panaka and several other security forces were also dispatched to rescue anyone imprisoned in the Trade Federation's prison camps, although they were only able to successfully extract a handful.

Next, Amidala informs Qui-Gon and Nass of her battle strategy: with the Grand Gungan Army acting as [[Battle of Naboo|a distraction]] to the bulk of the main Trade Federation forces, the Naboo resistance led by herself, Captain Panaka and the Jedi will infiltrate Theed via a secret entrance located inside one of the waterfalls. Nute Gunray, hearing reports of the Grand Army's assembly, informs Darth Sidious; Sidious orders Gunray to wipe out both the Gungans and the Naboo as the Trade Federation prepares for battle.

[[Captain]] [[Roos Tarpals]] orders the [[Gungan Grand Army]] to activate their [[Deflector shield|shield]], which protects them from ranged attack. [[OOM-9]] has his [[Armored Assault Tank Mk I|tanks]] fire first, but seeing them fail to penetrate the powerful shield, orders them to cease fire. [[Daultay Dofine]] gives the command to activate the battle droids. These droids march through the shield and open fire on the Grand Army, soon destroying the shield generator. As the tanks cause heavy casualties among the Gungans, defeat for the alliance seems imminent.

However, victory comes when young Anakin Skywalker accidentally takes control of a [[N-1 starfighter|starfighter]] and goes on to destroy the Federation's Droid Control Ship from the inside, killing Daultay Dofine and rendering the droid army useless. Meanwhile, Amidala and her force fight their way back into the [[Theed Royal Palace|royal palace]] and capture Nute Gunray.

[[File:DotF_TPM.png|thumb|right|250px|Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fight Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo.]]
At the same time, in a Theed [[Hangar|hangar bay]], Darth Maul engages in combat with the two Jedi, using his [[double-bladed lightsaber]]. The battle moves from the hangar, across a series of catwalks, to the Theed Generator Complex. During the fight, Obi-Wan is separated from his master by being kicked off of a catwalk. He grabs the edge of another catwalk below and jumps back up to where Qui-Gon and Maul continue to fight. By this time, Qui-Gon and Maul have become separated by a force field in the entrance to the Generator Room. Obi-Wan catches up to them, but is divided from his master by four force fields. When the force fields deactivate, Jinn and Maul continue their battle while Kenobi remains divided from the battle by one force field when they all reactivate.

After a lengthy duel, Maul suddenly stuns Qui-Gon by hitting him on the chin with his [[lightsaber]] handle, then rams his blade straight into Qui-Gon's chest, mortally wounding him. Devastated, Obi-Wan redoubles his assault upon Maul and chops the Sith's lightsaber in half, but Maul eventually overpowers and nearly kills Kenobi by [[Force push]]ing him over the edge of a seemingly bottomless reactor shaft. Obi-Wan saves himself from falling when he manages to grab onto a pipe protruding from the wall of the shaft. Maul kicks the Jedi's lightsaber into the pit and prepares to finish him off. After Obi-Wan calms himself, he uses the Force to leap out of the shaft and over Maul's head while summoning his fallen master's lightsaber to his hand. He lands behind the surprised Maul and cuts him in half; Maul's upper and lower body fall into the shaft.

Obi-Wan reaches Qui-Gon moments before he dies, as Qui-Gon instructs Obi-Wan to train Anakin to become a Jedi, reiterating that Anakin is the Chosen One. Obi-Wan gives his word that he will. Qui-Gon dies, leading to Obi-Wan to grieve for his deceased master. The newly elected Chancellor Palpatine arrives to congratulate Queen Amidala on her victory, as Nute Gunray is sent to stand trial for his crimes.

[[File:Naboo_celebration.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Gungans and the Naboo celebrate their victory.]]
Later, in a room in the queen's palace, [[Yoda]] confers upon Obi-Wan the rank of Jedi Knight. Kenobi argues with Yoda about his promise to Qui-Gon regarding Anakin's training. Yoda is convinced it is dangerous to train the boy, but tells Kenobi the Jedi Council has allowed Skywalker to become Kenobi's apprentice. Later that evening, in a temple in Theed, [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|Qui-Gon's body is cremated]], and [[Mace Windu]] and Yoda agree that the Sith are definitely to blame for the tragedy. As there are [[Rule of Two|only ever two Sith at any given time]] (a Master and an apprentice), both Masters believe that one must still remain.

The Naboo and Gungans organize a great victory celebration on the streets of Theed, in front on the palace. Obi-Wan and Anakin are present, the younger now wearing formal Jedi attire, and in his hair is a [[Padawan braid|special braid]]: the mark of a Jedi Padawan. The film ends with Queen Amidala presenting a gift of appreciation and friendship to Boss Nass and the Gungan people.

==Development==
Along the lines of ''[[Wikipedia:The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles|The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', all three [[prequel trilogy|prequel films]] were originally intended to be written and shot as one large production, and released back to back.<ref name="LFM 17">{{InsiderCite|17|George Lucas: The Future of the Force}}</ref> The [[Star Wars: Episode I The Beginning|first draft of the script]] was begun [[November 1]], [[1994]].<ref name=":0">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-episode-i-the-phantom-menace-oral-history|text="All Films Are Personal": An Oral History of ''Star Wars:'' Episode I ''The Phantom Menace''}}</ref>

The role of director was offered to [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Ron Howard]], and Robert Zemeckis. According to Howard, Lucas didn't necessarily want to direct Episode I. He further commented that all three directors turned down the position as the film was Lucas's "baby."<ref name="Howard">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ron-howard-turning-down-star-844107|title=Ron Howard on Turning Down 'Star Wars' Prequel: "Too Daunting"|author=Washington, Arlene|date=2015-11-29|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|The Hollywood Reporter]]]|archivedate=20160223043624}}</ref> The budget of ''Menace'' was estimated $115 million. Shooting took place from [[June 26]] to [[September 30]], [[1997]]. As with [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], Episode I's main exterior filming locations were in [[Tunisia]]. The podrace was filmed in a canyon near [[Sidi Bouhlel]] and [[Oung Jmel]]. A set was built near Oung Jmel to represent [[Mos Espa/Legends|Mos Espa]] on Tatooine. The [[Slave Quarters Row/Legends|Slave Quarters Row]] were filmed in ksour's near [[Wikipedia:Tataouine|Tataouine]] and [[Ksar Medenine]]. Small parts were filmed in Royal [[Caserta Palace]] in Italy and [[Whippendell Woods]] in the [[Wikipedia:United Kindom|United Kingdom]], but ''Hever Castle'' was later cut. Studio work was mainly done at [[Leavesden Studios]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{SW|url=news/fully-operational-fandom-visiting-star-wars-filming-locations|text=Fully Operational Fandom: Visiting Star Wars Filming Locations}}</ref>

Unlike the latter two films in the series which were shot on [[Wikipedia:Digital video|digital video]], most of this film was shot in 35 mm, with a few scenes shot in digital video.<ref name=":0" />

This episode was also the first of the saga to be referred to primarily by its number (''Episode One'') by media and fans, in contrast to the [[original trilogy]] the public already knew.{{Fact}}

==Release==
[[File:EpIVaderShadowPoster-SWE.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the most popular marketing posters for the film]]
''The Phantom Menace'' was the first ''[[Star Wars]]'' film in 16 years. As a result, there was almost unprecedented interest amongst both fans and the wider public in the revival of the franchise. The film received enormous media-created hype, which made [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm's]] $20 million advertising campaign&mdash;with the distinctive artwork of ''Star Wars'' series artist [[Drew Struzan]] gracing the movie poster and other advertising&mdash;seem modest and almost unnecessary. Few film studios released films during the same week as the release of ''The Phantom Menace''; among the more courageous were [[Wikipedia:DreamWorks|DreamWorks]] and [[Wikipedia:Universal Studios|Universal Studios]], with the releases of [[Wikipedia:The Love Letter|''The Love Letter'']] and [[Wikipedia:Notting Hill (film)|''Notting Hill'']] respectively. ''The Love Letter'' was a box-office flop, whereas ''Notting Hill'' fared rather well and followed ''The Phantom Menace'' closely in second place.<ref name="Un-Menaced">{{Imdb|url=news/sb/1999-04-01#film1|text=Un-Menaced|archivedate=20081216021024}}</ref> Challenger, Gray & Christmas of Chicago, a work-issues consulting firm, estimated that 2.2 million full-time employees did not appear for work to attend the film, resulting in $293 million in lost productivity. [[Wikipedia:The Wall Street Journal|''The Wall Street Journal'']] reported that such a large number of workers announced plans to view premiere screenings that many companies shut down on the premiere day.<ref name="Cultural">{{Imdb|url=news/sb/1999-05-06#film2|text=May 19th: A "Cultural Holiday?"|archivedate=20081216021044}}</ref> Many fans began waiting outside cinema theaters as early as a month in advance of ticket sales.<ref name="Lining">{{Imdb|url=news/sb/1999-03-08#film6|text=When Will They Start Lining Up?|archivedate=20081216020959}}</ref>

More theater lines appeared when it was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two weeks into the release. This was done out of fear that family theater-goers would either be unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher prices. Tickets were instead to be sold on a traditional first-come-first-serve basis.<ref name="Force">{{Imdb|url=news/sb/1999-03-26#film1|text=Force Of Feet|archivedate=20081216021019}}</ref> However, after meetings with the [[Wikipedia:National Association of Theatre Owners|National Association of Theatre Owners]], Lucasfilm agreed to allow advance ticket sales on [[May 12]], [[1999]], provided that there be a 12-ticket limit per customer.<ref name="Wait">{{Imdb|url=news/sb/1999-04-26#film1|text=The Wait Gets Shorter|archivedate=20081216021039}}</ref> As a result, however, some advance tickets were sold by "[[Wikipedia:Ticket resale|scalpers]]" as high as $100 apiece, which a distribution chief called "horrible," stating it was exactly what they wanted to avoid.<ref name="Scalpers">{{Imdb|url=news/sb/1999-05-18#film3|text=Scalpers Cleaning Up On The Internet|archivedate=20081216021049}}</ref> [[Wikipedia:Variety (magazine)|''Daily Variety'']] reported that theater owners received strict instructions from Lucasfilm that the film could only play in the cinema's largest auditorium for the first 8–12 weeks; no honor passes were allowed for the first eight weeks, and they were obligated to send their payments to distributor [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] within seven days.<ref name="Shots">{{Imdb|url=news/sb/1999-04-06#film1|text=Lucas Calls The Shots|archivedate=20081216021029}}</ref>

Despite worries about whether the film would be finished in time, two weeks prior to its debut Lucasfilm pushed the release date up from [[May 21]] to [[May 19]] of 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, Lucas stated that the change was to give the fans a "head start" by allowing them to view it over the week and allowing families the chance to view on the weekends.

===Merchandise===
====Soundtrack====
{{Main|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)}}

Two separate soundtracks were released for ''The Phantom Menace''. One, a traditional soundtrack, contained seventeen tracks of selections from the score. The second, an Ultimate Collector's Edition Soundtrack, compiled the score as it was presented in the film (with several minor alterations) in sixty-eight tracks.

Major musical themes and leitmotifs were introduced in the film, including the [[droid march]], "[[Duel of the Fates]]," [[Qui-Gon's Theme]], "[[The Adventures of Jar Jar]]," [[Darth Maul's Motif]], [[Anakin's Theme]], [[Shmi's motif]], "[[The Flag Parade]]," "[[Escape from Naboo]]," and the "[[Symponik Nabooalla]]."

During the credits at the end of the film, young Anakin's theme is heard playing, but during the last moments of the film, this theme morphs into the first few notes of the Darth Vader theme during the [[The Imperial March|Imperial March]], and, as the last logos of [[THX]] are scrolling by, three rasping breaths from Vader's respirator can be heard, referencing Anakin's eventual change into Darth Vader.

====Novelization====
{{Main|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)}}

A novelization of the movie was written by [[Terry Brooks]]. It includes three entire chapters of material created by Brooks and unique to the novel. The first two chapters of the book concern Anakin's next-to-last podrace and its aftermath, while a later chapter describes an encounter between Anakin and a wounded Tusken Raider in the desert.

Brooks met with Lucas before writing the book and received his approval and guidance, including information about developments to come in Episodes II and III. This can be seen in such passages as the Tusken Raider scene, which ironically foreshadows the death of Anakin's mother in Episode II, and the passage leading up to Anakin's fight with the Rodian child [[Greedo the Elder|Greedo]], indicating that Anakin's anger derives from his anguish at Padmé's impending departure (foreshadowing the plot of Episode III).

The novelization is especially well known for a passage describing the history of the Sith, including [[Darth Bane/Legends|Darth Bane]]. According to Terry Brooks's memoir, ''Sometimes the Magic Works'', Lucas spent an hour on the telephone with him discussing the history of the Jedi and the Sith. Therefore, the information on this subject provided in Brooks's novelization might derive from Lucas himself. The novelization is also the first mention of the [[Stark Hyperspace War]].

Brooks devotes an entire chapter of ''Sometimes the Magic Works'' to the writing of the Episode I novelization, which he claims to have been an extremely happy and fulfilling experience.

===Home video===
[[File:Ep1DVD.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Phantom Menace'' on [[Star Wars home video releases|DVD]]]]
The film was first released on VHS on April 4, 2000. There was a normal fullscreen release, and a widescreen collector's box set. The widescreen VHS contains an exclusive documentary titled "Filmmaking Has Turned A Corner." In addition the collector's set contains an excerpted version of ''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' and a set of film cells from a scene in the film.

''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' was the first Star Wars film to be officially released on [[Star Wars home video releases|DVD]]. This two-disc DVD was released on October 16, 2001.

The DVD features a commentary track by Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, editor [[Ben Burtt]], animation director [[Rob Coleman]], and visual effects supervisors [[John Knoll]], [[Dennis Muren]], and [[Scott Squires]].

The viewer can access a multi-angle storyboard-to-animatic-to-film segment featuring the submarine and podrace lap 1 sequences. The DVD includes two documentary sources, five featurettes exploring the storyline, design, costumes, visual effects, and fight sequences in the film, and an award-winning twelve-part web documentary series chronicling the production. The ''Duel of the Fates'' music video featuring [[John Williams]] was included on the DVD as well. The final special features included are a never-before-seen production photo gallery with a special caption feature, theatrical posters and print campaigns from around the world, a theatrical teaser and launch trailers, seven TV spots, ''Star Wars: Starfighter - The Making of a Game'' featurette from [[LucasArts]], and a DVD-ROM weblink to exclusive ''Star Wars'' content.

The DVD became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the US, after 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1617965.stm|title=Star Wars breaks DVD records|date=2001-10-24|work=[http://news.bbc.co.uk BBC News]|archivedate=20191113210415}}</ref> However, some reviewers criticized the DVD for the excessive use of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_enhancement edge enhancement] that degraded the DVD's picture quality.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.videophile.info/Review/TPM/TPM_01.htm|title=

At the DVD press conference for ''Revenge of the Sith'', prequel trilogy animation director Rob Coleman confirmed that the animation department at Lucasfilm had replaced the Yoda puppet from the original version of the film with a digital Yoda. This was done to better match up the look of the Yoda from ''The Phantom Menace'' with that of the other two films of the prequel trilogy, as well as with the Yoda from the original trilogy. This change has been, for the most part, welcomed by fans, in contrast to the original puppet Yoda as seen in ''The Phantom Menace''.

A preview of these changes can be viewed on the ''Revenge of the Sith'' DVD that was released on November 1, 2005. The clip is included as part of "The Chosen One" featurette. However, when Coleman announced the change, he didn't specify when the revised version of ''The Phantom Menace'' would be released.<ref>{{Hyperspace|url=hyperspace/member/episode-iii/bts/setdiary/news20050921.html|text=Episode III Set Diary - A Shifting in the Force}}</ref>

''The Phantom Menace'' was re-released along with Episodes II&ndash;VI on [[Star Wars: The Complete Saga|Blu-ray]] in [[September]] [[2011]].<ref>{{SWArchive|url=movies/saga/bluraymay4/index.html|text=Bring the Complete Collection Home: ''Star Wars: The Complete Saga'' on Blu-Ray|archivedate=20110507103835}}</ref>
For this release, the film went through a restoration process which restored the picture to its full frame (offering around 8% more picture than its DVD release). The Blu-ray release was also marked by the replacement of the puppet for the CGI model of Yoda used in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], as well as a few corrections of visual effects and technical errors.

On [[April 7]], [[2015]], the Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released ''Star Wars'' films. As Lucasfilm had retained digital distribution rights to Episodes I thru III and V thru VI, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released ''The Phantom Menace'' for digital download on [[April 10]], 2015.<ref>{{SW|url=news/the-star-wars-digital-movie-collection-coming-april-10|text=The ''Star Wars'' Digital Movie Collection Coming April 10}}</ref>

Despite the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company's]] [[2012]] purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the release rights to all future ''Star Wars'' films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to ''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'', which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through [[May]] [[2020]], at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tangled-rights-could-tie-up-384541|title=Tangled Rights Could Tie Up Ultimate 'Star Wars' Box Set (Analysis)|author=Masters, Kim|date=2012-10-30|work=The Hollywood Reporter|archivedate=20200215125918}}</ref> On [[December 14]], [[2017]], The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring most of Fox's parent company, [[Wikipedia:21st Century Fox|21st Century Fox]], including the film studio and all distribution rights to ''A New Hope''.<ref name="Acquire">{{DisneyCompany|url=walt-disney-company-acquire-twenty-first-century-fox-inc-spinoff-certain-businesses-52-4-billion-stock-2|text=The Walt Disney Company To Acquire Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., After Spinoff Of Certain Businesses, For $52.4 Billion In Stock|archivedate=20200617112439}}</ref> On [[March 20]], [[2019]], the [[Wikipedia:Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|deal]] was officially completed.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-closes-fox-deal-creating-global-content-powerhouse-1174498|title=Disney Closes $71.3 Billion Fox Deal, Creating Global Content Powerhouse|author=Georg Szalai, Paul Bond|date=2019-03-19|work=[[Wikipedia:The Hollywood Reporter|The Hollywood Reporter]]|archivedate=20200611175708}}</ref> On [[April 12]], 2019, a [[Wikipedia:Blu-ray|Blu-ray]] box set containing the nine main installments of the ''Star Wars'' [[Star Wars saga|saga]] remastered in 4K was reportedly announced to be in development for a [[2020]] release.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/film/content/105409/exclusive-skywalker-saga-4k|title=Exclusive: Disney are working on a 4K Blu-ray box set for Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga (updated)|date=2019-04-12|work=[https://www.thedigitalfix.com/film The Digital Fix: Film]|archivedate=20190506104719}}</ref>

===3D re-release===
[[File:Episode_I_3D_poster.png|thumb|right|Official poster for ''The Phantom Menace'' 3D release]]
On [[September 28]], [[2010]], [[StarWars.com]] and Lucasfilm announced that the entire ''Star Wars'' saga would be converted to stereoscopic 3D and re-released in theaters and IMAX 3D, beginning with ''Episode I''. [[John Knoll]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic]] are supervising the conversion.<ref>{{SWArchive|url=movies/saga/announce3d/index.html|text=The ''Star Wars'' Saga in 3D!|archivedate=20100930203021}}</ref> The stereo conversion process has been in the works for several years, however, with George Lucas showing tests of the ''Episode II'' speeder chase scene and a reel from ''Episode IV'' in 3D during 2005's ShoWest in Las Vegas, and the speeder chase scene was demoed again by Texas Instruments as an emerging technology at SIGGRAPH 2007 in San Diego.

Episode I's 3D release date, as announced by Lucasfilm on [[March 3]], [[2011]], was [[February 10]], [[2012]].<ref name="TFNTPMDate">{{Cite_web|url=http://theforce.net/latestnews/story/The_Phantom_Menace_3D_Gets_A_Release_Date_136942.asp|title=''The Phantom Menace'' 3D Gets A Release Date|author=Eric|date=2011-03-03|work=[http://www.theforce.net TheForce.Net]|archivedate=20190730101254}}</ref>

==Reception==
{{Quote|A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, people made movies with people in them, and some of those movies made sense. Then something happened, and the people started to vanish from the movies, along with most of the sense. For a while, the spectacle was fun to observe, but slowly the pictures tipped into insanity, or, at any rate, into the hypnotically bad. The joke was that the number of viewers willing to submit to such hypnosis went not down but through the roof. Historians of this phenomenon are now agreed that the change became irrevocable shortly before the end of the second millennium, with a George Lucas film entitled ''Star Wars: Episode I&mdash;The Phantom Menace''. [&hellip;] ''The Phantom Menace'' is at once childishly unknowing and rotten with cynicism. I would call it the disappointment of the decade except that, along with many other people, I had a sneaking fear that it would turn out this way. What is this? Crap. Say it out loud: Crap. And will it make the magic billion dollars? You bet.|Film critic [[Wikipedia:Anthony Lane|Anthony Lane's]] review of ''The Phantom Menace'', from [[Wikipedia:The New Yorker|''The New Yorker'']], May 24, 1999|url=http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/The-Epic-Saga-Prints_i13933861_.htm}}
Critical and fan reaction ranged from high praise to outright derision. The much-hyped special effects, while generally viewed as groundbreaking in their sheer scope, were perhaps less impressive than anticipated simply because of high expectations. This attitude was confirmed with the rival film, ''The Matrix'', winning the visual effects Academy Award for that year over ''The Phantom Menace''. It was the first time a ''Star Wars'' film lost in that Oscar competition category. Many critics heavily criticized the acting of [[Natalie Portman]] and especially [[Jake Lloyd]] as the young Anakin Skywalker. Some aspects of the scripting and direction were also criticized. Extra venom was directed at the character of [[Jar Jar Binks/Legends|Jar Jar Binks]], who was regarded by some fans as purely a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character in the film. Fan reaction was mixed too, with some fans praising the film while others having a negative opinion of it.

However, despite some of the negative criticisms leveled at the film, many others gave praise to ''The Phantom Menace''. William Arnold, of the ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', commented that the massive of hype of the film may have caused much of the negative reaction to the film, saying "it built expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled element of storytelling surprise." He also felt "it's well made and entertaining" and believed it was much better than similar box-office fare released around that time period, such as ''The Mummy'' and ''The Matrix''.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/movies/starq.shtml|title='Episode I': Avoid the hype, just go enjoy the movie|author=William, Arnold|date=1999-05-14|publisher=[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com seattle P-I]|archivedate=20020224000551}}</ref> David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com remarked that the better moments of the film "don't merely balance out the weaker ones- they topple them."<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_i_the_phantom_menace|title=Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|publisher=[http://www.rottentomatoes.com Rotten Tomatoes]|archivedate=20200731230546}}</ref> Roger Ebert gave the film three and half out of four stars, calling it "an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking," and stating that "Lucas tells a good story." Ebert comments that it was perfectly fine for the characters to be a bit less compelling, seeing that they were just being introduced, and stating to "give me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day."<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990517/REVIEWS/905170301/1023|title=Star Wars -- Episode I: The Phantom Menace|author=Ebert, Roger|date=1999-05-17|publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com|archivedate=20060808204837}}</ref> Mark Dinning labels ''The Phantom Menace'' "A great work from a great director, and a blockbuster of quite the most swashbuckling kind." Many fans and critics also agree that the lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul&mdash;showcasing astounding choreography and [[Ray Park]]'s martial arts skills&mdash;is a high point, and one of the best lightsaber duels in the ''Star Wars'' saga.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=http://www.renaissancemag.com/arts/movies/default.asp?article=0599c|title=The Phantom Menace|author=Kevin, RidolFi|publisher=[http://www.renaissancemag.com Renaissance Online Magazine]|archivedate=20181215121630}}</ref>

The film was nominated for three [[Wikipedia:Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]—Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects; however, it lost to ''[[Wikipedia:The Matrix|The Matrix]] ''in all three categories. The film won Best Motion Picture at the People's Choice Awards. It was also nominated for the [[Wikipedia:Saturn Awards|Saturn Awards]] on the categories of Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (George Lucas), Best Actor (Liam Neeson), Best Supporting Actor (Ewan McGregor), Best Young Actor (Jake Lloyd), Best Young Actress (Natalie Portman), Best Supporting Actress (Pernilla August), Best Screenplay (George Lucas), Best Music (John Williams), Best Special Effects and Best Makeup.

==Deleted scenes==
*'''The Waterfall Sequence'''&mdash;As Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Jar Jar arrive in the waterways of Theed, in the bongo, they surface just in front of a huge waterfall and have to vacate the vehicle in a hurry.
*'''Dawn Before the Podrace'''&mdash;Anakin gets up early to prepare the pod for the race and has a brief chat with Padmé.
*'''Complete Podrace Grid Sequence'''&mdash;This scene shows more of the participating racers and creatures in the crowd, later added on DVD.
*'''Extended Podrace Lap Two'''&mdash;This lap shows some more of Sebulba's "creative interpretation of the rules" and further proof of just how special Anakin is, later added on DVD.
*'''Anakin's Scuffle With Greedo'''&mdash;This was due to follow the podrace, to show Anakin's potential for aggression, but George Lucas cut it because he wanted Anakin to be shown as a genuinely good character who turns evil later in adulthood.
*'''Farewell to Jira'''&mdash;This occurs as Qui-Gon and Anakin are leaving Mos Espa and Anakin stops briefly to say goodbye to Jira. One of Darth Maul's probe droids follows them for some time until Qui-Gon finally notices and destroys it before passing by the ''[[Dusty Duck]]''.
*'''The Air Taxi Sequence'''&mdash;The taxi ride shows us about ten more seconds of Coruscant, later added on DVD.
