==Trivia==
*The lion in this cartoon bears a noticeable resemblance to [[Lambert Lion]]Â to the point that some of his animation is recycled from Lambert's.
*The cartoon originally had a red sunburst "The End" title (as seen on Erik's video of the original RKO titles on YouTube<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWuEjpZBRhI original RKO titles by Erik on YouTube]</ref>), but on the existing Buena Vista reissue title which kept the original opening titles (except the RKO logo is plastered out by the Buena Vista logo), the ending title was changed to the 1959 version (as seen on many Buena Vista reissue prints of classic Disney cartoons and in [[How to Have an Accident at Work]]) for unknown reasons.
