'''''Kidnapped''''' is a [[1960]] Walt Disney Productions film adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel, Kidnapped. It stars Peter Finch and James MacArthur and was Disney's second production based on a novel by Stevenson.

==Plot==
In eighteenth-century Scotland, young David Balfour is directed by his recently-deceased father's letter to go to the House of Shaws, where he is greeted without much enthusiasm by his miserly uncle Ebenezer. An attempt to arrange a fatal accident makes it clear that Ebenezer has no affection for his nephew. However, David is not sufficiently on his guard. He accompanies Ebenezer to a meeting with a seafaring business associate, Captain Hoseason. The captain lures David aboard his ship and shanghais him, at Ebenezer's instigation.

At sea, David learns that he is to be sold into indentured servitude. However, a thick fog comes up and the ship collides with a boat. Alan Breck Stewart, the only survivor of the latter, is brought aboard and pays for his passage, but the greedy captain plots to kill him for the rest of his money. David warns Alan, and the two are able to overcome the murderous crew. Alan coerces Hoseason into putting them ashore. The ship founders, but David manages to reach land alone.

After several dangerous encounters, he is rescued by Alan, who turns out to be a Jacobite wanted by the authorities. Evading the soldiers, the two make their way back to the House of Shaws, where Alan tricks Ebenezer into admitting his crimes within the hearing of a hidden witness, allowing David to claim his inheritance.
