'''''The Cat from Outer Space''''' is a [[1978]] Disney film starring [[Ronnie Schell]], Ken Berry, [[Sandy Duncan]], [[Harry Morgan]], [[Roddy McDowall]], and McLean Stevenson.

==Plot==
An unidentified flying object makes an emergency landing on Earth and is taken into custody by the United States government. The occupant of the "flying saucer" turns out to be a cat-like alien named [[Zunar-J-5/9 Doric-4-7]], or Jake (voiced by Ronnie Schell) as he is called by his human friends (a tawny Abyssinian cat; a role shared by two cats named Amber and Rumple).

Using a special collar, he is able to communicate with humans (as well as perform feats of levitation and even take a wrecked plane into the air). The cat wants American scientists to help him find some "Org 12" so that his craft may rendezvous with his mother ship, and eventually settles on Dr. Frank Wilson (Ken Berry).

After Frank determines that "Org 12" is gold when Jake tells its atomic weight (196.967), Jake uses his collar's powers to affect the outcome of various sporting events, including horse races and pool games, to win money to buy the needed gold and repair his saucer. In the end, Jake sends his flying saucer back to the mother ship, staying on Earth with Frank, his girlfriend Liz ([[Sandy Duncan]]) and her cat, Lucy.

==Trivia==
*NBA Hall of Famer "Pistol" Pete Maravich and Pat Riley are seen on a clip of a 1971 NBA Hawks-Lakers basketball game.
*At a crucial scene near the half-mark of the film, Jake levitates Frank and a motorcycle across an army barricade to escape pursuit. This type of visual gag had been used before in both Disney's ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]'' and ''[[Return from Witch Mountain]]''Â and the sequence resembles a similar one later seen in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''.
* This movie was suppose to get sequel in form of a TV series but it was cancelled during production
* It's one of the movies to receive ''Unofficial Official Trailer'' when Disney+ was first released
