He then accidentally puts his face in the poster which Dale thought his friend turned to crime. Pete shows up at his hiding spot and stashes the money in a chest he hid in a tree. The tree the chest was in was also the home of Chip and Dale with their stash of acorns. Pete then make breakfast while singing Home on The Range. Seeing the wanted outlaw, they make many attempts to capture him. They try to pull him off with a rock on a rope. Chip is held by Pete which he thought was a salt shaker. Chip is suddenly pulled away which panics Pete who hides behind a rock and begins firing wildly at nothing. He brushes it off, then Chip and Dale load a tobacco bag with gunpowder from some of Pete's bullets and turns it into a cigarette. He throws it away which it lands behind the chipmunks and explodes. Pete again panics and fires blindly. He then becomes frantic and decides to move on He grabs his chest only to find it full of acorns. He finds his money on the ground in a path. He gathers the money while ironically falling into a pit trap. He finds the chipmunks and begins to shoot at them. They retreat to their tree. They then attempt to take one of the guns away from Pete. Chip pulls out the gun but falls due to the weight of the gun. It suddenly begins to fire off out of control, Pete retaliates pulling out his gun but instead pulls out Dale who was stuck in the holster to which Dale acts like a gun. Chip then points the gun at Pete to which he surrenders. Chip then ironically twirls the gun too fast to which he twirls with it. The gun then goes off again which shoots off his hat and grazes some hair off his head. Pete then tries to sweet talk his way out which Chip denies, He spins the chamber of the gun which falls out of the gun disarming it.
