'''''Child Star: The Shirley Temple Story''''' is a [[2001]] television movie that aired on ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' on [[ABC]]. It starred [[Emily Hart]] and [[Ashley Rose Orr]] as [[Shirley Temple]] and was directed by Nadia Tass. It is a biopic on the history of Temple's career in [[Hollywood]] acting.

==Summary==
Between [[1934]] and [[1940]], Shirley Temple was the biggest little star in Hollywood; she began doing song-and-dance numbers in one-reel comedies at the age of four, at six she stole the show in the musical ''Stand Up and Cheer'', and at ten she was the number one box-office attraction in America, and had even taken home a special Oscar. Based on her 1988 autobiography, the film stars Ashley Rose Orr as her in a story that concentrates on the sunny side of her rise to fame and soft-peddles allegations that her parents (here played by Connie Britton and Colin Friels) mismanaged the fortune she earned during her years as a preteen celebrity. The film was produced by the mother-and-daughter team of Paula and [[Melissa Joan Hart]]; they have their own perspective on life as a youthful celebrity, thanks to Melissa's career as the star of the TV series ''Clarissa Explains It All'' and ''Sabrina, the Teenage Witch'', while her younger sister, [[Emily Hart]], appears in the film as the teenage Temple.
