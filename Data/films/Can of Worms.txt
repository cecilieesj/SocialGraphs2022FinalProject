==Plot==
Mike Pillsbury (Michael Shulman) is a young man who feels he does not belong on Earth. He tries to win the heart of his friend, Katelyn (Erika Christensen), by helping out with the Halloween Dance, which is sabotaged by his rival, Scott Tribler. Upset, he sends a message into space asking to be rescued from Earth, unaware that aliens have heard it and plan on visiting.

An alien called Thoad arrives on Earth in order to claim Mike for his "zoo". His friend's brother is kidnapped, and with help from Scott, as well as another alien, Barnabus ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), he manages to travel to Thoad's lair and rescue his friend's brother and all the creatures trapped in the zoo. However, Thoad follows them back to Earth and attempts to take Mike with him to his lair, but Barnabus calls the Intergalactic Police, and Thoad is arrested and taken into custody. Barnabus tells Mike that Earth is safe again, and asks him to return to his home planet with him, but Mike tells him he at last feels that he belongs on Earth, and they say goodbye.
