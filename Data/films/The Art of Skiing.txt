'''''The Art of Skiing''''' is a ''[[Goofy]]'' cartoon made by [[Walt Disney Productions]] in [[1941]]. It has historical significance as the first cartoon to use the Goofy holler, recorded by Hannes Schroll. as well as being the short that led to the "How To" series, beginning with ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'' and continuing with ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]].''

==Synopsis==
[[Goofy]] goes to Sugar Bowl Ski Resort, to learn how to ski. The name of the resort can be seen in the opening frames of the cartoon. Sugar Bowl Ski Resort was used because [[Walt Disney]] had an interest in the Sugar Bowl ski area, to the extent that one of the peaks at Sugar Bowl is named Mt. Disney after him. 

==Characters==
*[[Goofy]] (voiced by Hanes Schroll)
*[[The How-to Narrator|Narrator]] (voiced by [[John McLeish]])

==Trivia==
*The narrator mentions the alternate pronunciation of skiing as "shiing" ("<u>shee</u>ing").
**Another Goofy cartoon featured Goofy mentioning this to an Ancient Greek.
*The Sugar Bowl was founded and owned, at the time, by noted skier Hannes Schroll, who performed all the yodeling in the short, including the now infamous "Goofy yell".
*The premiere of this short was held at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, which was hosting the Annual Skiers Ball. Walt Disney and his wife, Lillian, attended the event, and Walt introduced the cartoon to the audience.

== ''Have a Laugh!'' changes ==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
* Goofy getting out of bed and putting on the skis, then getting back in bed before being yelled out of bed by the narrator (it cuts from the alarm clock going off to Goofy jumping out of bed with the skis already on).
* The entire scene of Goofy struggling with his sweater.
* The narrator reciting "Ode to a Mountain" during the panoramic view of the mountain.
* Goofy struggling with the first step of skiing, the turn into position.
* Goofy "getting the hang" of skiing when he gets his head stuck in a ski boot.
* The herringbone ascent.
* Goofy's jump turn.
* Goofy slaloming between flags and crashing into a tree.
* Goofy flying through the air, trying to dodge mountaintops.

==Notes==
* The scene of Goofy going backwards on his skis was done as a compromise by the animators when they kept arguing which direction Goofy should be skiing.
