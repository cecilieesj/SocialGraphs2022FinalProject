'''''Donald's Dilemma''''' is a [[1947]] Walt Disney Productions animated cartoon directed by Jack King and starring [[Donald Duck|Donald]] and [[Daisy Duck]]. It was originally released on [[July 11]], [[1947]] in the [[United States]]. Although Donald is the official headliner for this cartoon, Daisy is the actual protagonist. The dilemma of the title is actually offered to her, not to Donald.

==Synopsis==
The short starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. While he regained consciousness soon enough, he wasn't the same Donald we all know and love: his singing voice was improved to Frank Sinatra and he had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]" from ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'' (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so (which included attempting to get by the doorman by pleading, disguise, and force with the same result of the doorman kicking her out). That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon.

At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or the other way around. Posed with the question "her or the world", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - "me, me, me". After calming her down, the psychologist tells Daisy to put the same flower she found into a heavy pot. Compared to before, Daisy is able to enter the stage door since the doorman has fallen asleep and drops the flower pot on Donald. The plan works and Donald's voice is back to normal, yet at a terrible cost: the crowd boos him and soon enough he gets kicked out of the stage. Donald is happy to see Daisy again, asks where she's been, and kisses her as the short ends.
