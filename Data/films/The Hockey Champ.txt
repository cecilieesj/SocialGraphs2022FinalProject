==Trivia==
*In the beginning of the short, Donald imitates [[wikipedia:Sonja Henie|Sonja Henie]], a well-known Olympic figure skater and film star.
*In airings on ''[[The Ink and Paint Club (show)|The Ink and Paint Club]]'', the scene showing Donald in what appears to be a hangman's noose was deleted, possibly so as not to scare kids.

==''Have a Laugh!'' changes==
The following scenes were deleted from the short release due to time constraints:
*The entire opening of Donald's elegant figure skating, as Sonja Henie.
*Donald dodging as the hockey puck flies over his head, bounces off a tree, and hits the nephews, knocking them into the net.
*Donald lecturing the nephews on putting the puck in the net, then showing off his "Duck Swamp Champion" trophy to them.
*Donald's hockey prowess is shortened.
*Donald repeatedly hitting the puck in the net with his body.
*Donald telling the nephews, covered in snow, "You boys are awful!", and them coming out of the snow in anger.
*The nephews huddling to form a strategy before they start playing again.
*Donald's chase with the nephews is heavily shortened (it goes from him starting after them to him taking on the shape of a train engine from the snow), cutting out, among others:
**Donald crashing into a wall of ice with the nephews' reflections on it as they razz him.
**Donald and the nephews in the snow, with only their hockey sticks sticking out.
**Donald in the well.
*The nephews hitting Donald, who had accidentally swallowed the puck, so that it briefly flies out of his mouth before he accidentally swallows it again.
