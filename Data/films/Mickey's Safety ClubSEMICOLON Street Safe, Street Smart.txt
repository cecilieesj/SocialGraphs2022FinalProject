== Plot ==
Alex, Samantha, and Jeremy, soon to visit the clubhouse, are shown making bad safety decisions.  Alex is walking down the sidewalk with headphones on playing music and isn't aware of a car pulling out of a driveway.  He walks in front of it and the car stops quickly.  Samantha is over at a friend's house when her mom calls her to come for lunch.  Samantha says goodbye to her friend and leaves, but crosses at an edge between parked cars where she can't be seen.  She accidentally walks in front of a car that stops immediately upon seeing her.  Jeremy is found walking through town when he comes across an alley.  Rather than continuing on the sidewalk, he decides to take the shortcut through the alley.  As he walks through, a car begins following him.  Jeremy looks behind him at the driver who appears to be a bad stranger.  Jeremy begins to feel scared and keeps walking away.  The stranger keeps driving after him, stops where Jeremy is, and looks at him.  Jeremy then accidentally drops his books.

Jeremy stoops to pick them up, but Mickey picks them up for him.  Jeremy thanks him, but drops his books again upon the surprise that it's Mickey.  Mickey welcomes him to the clubhouse and takes him to meet Alex and Samantha.  Then, he takes them all to meet the safety expert, a machine named Flip who welcomes them to the clubhouse with a song.

Jeremy is chosen to be the first to choose a button and chooses one with a house.  Flip then shows Jeremy getting ready to leave the house.  Just as he's about to leave, Flip tells Jeremy to push the 'Stop' button for a question: "What should you always do before leaving your house?"  Jeremy correctly answers that you have to tell your mom or dad where you're going.  Flip confirms the answer is correct and goes over the rule: always tell a responsible person where your going before leaving the house; this can be your mom or dad, an older brother or sister, or a babysitter.  Jeremy is then permitted to choose another button which takes them to his most recent safety mistake.  He comes across the place he was previously, chooses to take the shortcut down the alley, and pulls Flip's lever in that direction.  Alex points out the car following him; Jeremy points out that he didn't know what to do and asks Flip if that's why he was brought to the clubhouse.  Flip answers in the affirmative.  Flip tells Jeremy to start with how he was feeling; Jeremy points out that he felt scared like he should get out and get help.  Samantha and Alex suggest a police officer or a shopkeeper as people to get help from.  Flip praises them saying, "First rate thought-processing, everyone!" Jeremy then promises not to take shortcuts anymore.  Mickey then plays the safety song from Alex's radio before moving on.  While the others dance along, Alex becomes confused as to how the song is playing from his radio, but quickly begins to enjoy it as well.

At the song's conclusion, Flip reminds them of the importance of not talking to strangers and if anything or anyone makes you feel uncomfortable, run and tell an adult.

Samantha asks what you should do if there is no adult in the area to tell.  Mickey then pushes a button with a telephone on it and an oversize telephone rings.  Mickey tells Samantha it's for her and she goes to answer it.  The phone reminds her that, whether you're at home or on the street, you can use a phone to call for help.  Samantha remembers that she can call her parents at work or her neighbors and hangs up.  Alex comes over, picks up the phone, and goes over what to do in emergencies.  He reminds Samantha that, to get immediate help in an emergency, to dial 911 or 0 for places without an emergency number.  Then calmly explain what the emergency is.  Right when he's about to hang up, the phone asks if he's forgetting something.  Alex thinks for a moment then remembers.  He tells Samantha to always provide your full name, address, and phone number with area code.  The phone also reminds them not to hang up until you've provided all the necessary information and the operator tells you it's okay to hang up.

Mickey praises Alex for knowing what to do and Alex accidentally presses a wrong button on Flip that causes him to go haywire.  Samantha is able to press the 'Stop" button in time.  Jeremy asks if Flip's alright; Flip answers in the affirmative, but points out that it could have been serious, "My micro-processing unit could've blown."  Alex apologizes and says he was just having fun.  Flip tells him that even when we're having fun, it's important to be careful and turns it over to Samantha.

Flip tells Samantha to hit the 'Replay' button.  They're then taken back to when Samantha was leaving her friend's house and crossed at the edge between the parked cars where she stepped in front of a moving car.  Samantha admits that she should've remembered to cross at a corner or at a crosswalk; she forgot since she was in a hurry.  Jeremy reminds her that it's also important to look both ways before you cross.  Flip also reminds them that it's also important to walk with another person.

Alex pushes the 'Stop' button and tells them, while it has been fun helping them, he has to get back.  Flip tells him to simply input his last location.  After three tries, Alex admits that he really can't remember where he last was.  Flip tells him that it's important to be aware of where you are and where you're going so you don't get lost or confused.  Alex shows his understanding and, at Flip's direction, pushes the 'Replay' button.  Flip shows them Alex's last unsafe choice: wearing headphones while on the sidewalk and unknowingly walking in front of a car pulling out of a driveway.  Alex sheepishly tells them that he didn't see the car.  Mickey thanks him and explains that he showed them a very important safety rule which Flip then explains: cars can come in and out of driveways fast, so stay alert and know what's going on around you.

The safety song plays again from Alex's radio to wrap up the show.  Mickey gives Alex, Jeremy, and Samantha each a badge dubbing them official members of Mickey's Safety Club.  The previous scenes are shown again with Alex, Jeremy, and Samantha making safer choices: Alex keeps his headphones off, sees the outcoming car, and stops to let it go; Samantha, after leaving her friend's house, goes to cross at a corner; Jeremy comes to the alley, but chooses to keep on the sidewalk.  The three of them meet up again at the walkway to a crosswalk and are surprised to see each other again.  Jeremy drops his books again, but Alex and Samantha help him pick them up again.  Mickey ends the episode by telling them they make a great safety team.
