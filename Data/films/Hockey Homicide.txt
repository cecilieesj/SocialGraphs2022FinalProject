'''''Hockey Homicide''''' is a [[1945]] ''[[Goofy]]'' cartoon directed by [[Jack Kinney]].

==Synopsis==
Narrator Doodles Weaver explains the rules of ice hockey in satirical format. The narration's emphasis on good sportsmanship is countered by the violence of the players (all of them "played" by [[Goofy]]). A running gag throughout involves Ice Box Bertino and Fearless Ferguson getting repeatedly sent into the penalty box for roughhousing. Eventually, confusion over many extra hockey pucks leads the players and spectators to get into a massive brawl and a severe riot, during which snippets from other Disney cartoons (including ''[[Pinocchio (film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[How to Play Football]]'', ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'', and ''[[Victory Through Air Power]]'') are included to emphasize the mass confusion.
