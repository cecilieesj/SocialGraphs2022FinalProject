'''''Operation Dumbo Drop''''' is a [[1995]] American war comedy film directed by Simon Wincer that explores war, politics, and animal welfare. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Gene Quintano and Jim Kouf based on a true story by United States Army Major Jim Morris. The film stars [[Danny Glover]] and [[Ray Liotta]] as Green Berets during the Vietnam War in 1968, who attempt to transport an elephant through jungle terrain to a local South Vietnamese village which in turn helps American forces monitor Viet Cong activity.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by Interscope Communications and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It was distributed by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] for home media.

''Operation Dumbo Drop'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on [[July 28]], 1995, grossing $24,670,346 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was a moderate financial success after its theatrical run, but was generally met with negative critical reviews.

==Plot==
During the Vietnam War in [[1968]], Captain Sam Cahill ([[Danny Glover]]) has been working hard to create good relations between the United States and Montagnard Vietnamese in the village of Dak Nhe. The U.S. Army is looking to monitor enemy operations on a clandestine weapons supply route which passes near the village. Cahill is coming close to his discharge, and explains to his successor Captain T.C. Doyle ([[Ray Liotta]]) the delicate nature of Vietnamese customs as well as the counter intelligence involving covert enemy activity. In a lapse of judgment with surrounding village children, a child steals a Nestlé Crunch bar from Doyle's backpack; the wrapper, when found, lets the NVA know of the local villagers' cooperation with the Americans. As punishment, Brigadier Nguyen (Hoang Ly) of the NVA, orders his subordinate, Captain Quang (Vo Trung Anh), to kill the villagers' elephant right before a spiritual festival. To aid the villagers, Cahill promises to replace the slain elephant before their upcoming ceremony while Doyle (whom the villagers blame for the elephant's death) reluctantly agrees to help.

At camp, Major Pederson (Marshall Bell), assigns Cahill and Doyle, with Doyle in command, to secure and deliver a new elephant to the villagers, as well as two soldiers, Specialist 4 Harvey Ashford ([[Doug E. Doug]]) and Specialist 5 Lawrence Farley (Corin Nemec). Cahill blackmails Chief Warrant Officer 3 Davis Poole ([[Denis Leary]]) into helping as well. They purchase an elephant known as Bo Tat from a local Vietnamese trader ([[James Hong]]). They also agree to take along Bo Tat's handler, Linh (Dinh Thien Le), who has experience with verbal commands in guiding the elephant. Along the way, NVA soldiers attempt to stop them. Following a failed air transport, the soldiers use a combination of methods to reach Pleiku Air Base before the final stage of their journey to Dak Nhe.

At Pleiku Air Base, Major Pederson notifies the captains that the mission has been cancelled. The enemy supply route has changed direction, and they no longer need the support of the local village. Against regulations, they commandeer a cargo aircraft. The aircraft comes under enemy fire, forcing them and Bo Tat to parachute out early. They land unharmed in and around the village, except for Ashford, who gets stuck in a tree and becomes separated from the rest. NVA forces suddenly appear, threatening to take the remaining soldiers hostage and kill the elephant. Ashford, however, is able to free himself and create a diversion long enough to distract and incapacitate the NVA troops. They complete their mission and, to the delight of the U.S. Army, capture high-ranking enemy officers in the process.

==Production==
===Development===
The premise of ''Operation Dumbo Drop'' is based on the true story relating to the cooperation of South Vietnamese villagers and the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War in the late 1960s.<ref name="crimson">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1995/8/1/operation-dumbo-drop-two-tons-of/ |title=Operation Dumbo Drop: Two Tons of Weak Humor |publisher=''The Harvard Crimson'' |accessdate=2010-08-18}}</ref> The U.S. Army viewed many villages as having a strategic value due to their proximity to enemy weapons supply routes, such as the Ho Chi Minh trail.<ref name="crimson" /> Elephants found in villages were typically the primary source of farm labor. To appease hostile villagers, the U.S. offered elephants as a token of appreciation. According to actor Glover, one such operation took place specifically on April 4, 1968, but received fairly little coverage due to the death on the same day of a Vietnamese military leader and also the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Memphis.<ref name="crimson" /> The film is based on a story depicted by retired United States Army Major Jim Morris, who related his experiences surrounding the elephant air-drops during the war.

A 26-year-old Asian elephant Tai was used for the part of ''Bo Tat''. The female elephant was chosen for the part because of her calm demeanor and friendly disposition, which allowed her to be placid and relaxed during scenes with simulated gunfire.<ref name="humane">{{cite web|url=http://www.ahafilm.info/movies/moviereviews.phtml?fid=7056 |title=Operation Dumbo Drop |publisher=''American Humane'' |accessdate=2010-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301025408/http://www.ahafilm.info/movies/moviereviews.phtml?fid=7056 |archivedate=March 1, 2007 }}</ref> Many depictions in the film such as the elephant being sedated and lying down or following that, moving her legs and standing up were actually accomplished with an animal trainer.<ref name="humane" />

===Set design and filming===
Principal filming took place primarily on location in Thailand.<ref name="movies.yahoo.com" /> Other filming locations included film studios in Los Angeles, California and Miami, Florida.<ref name="movies.yahoo.com" />

Certain scenes where the elephant was shown aboard a marine boat actually had I-beams under the deck to support the animal. Additionally, ballast was added to the boat to keep it afloat.<ref name="humane" /> One of the later scenes where the elephant was supposedly aboard the aircraft while under gun and missile fire was filmed in cuts, with both fake elephants and a mechanical elephant being used in the jump. The real elephant was used only for close-ups.<ref name="humane" />

During the village food cart scene, a trainer as an extra, ran alongside the elephant telling her to keep moving. There was also another trainer in front of her encouraging her constant movement and ensuring that nothing got in her path. Wire was attached to crates and tables to pull them over as the elephant ran by, making it appear as though she were knocking everything aside.<ref name="humane" /> In a flashback scene, the character of Linh sees an elephant being shot, as he tells of how his parents were killed. The film crew accomplished this feat by instructing the trainer to tell the elephant to lie down, while then shooting the scene in slow motion.<ref name="humane" /> To ensure the health of the elephant, her food and water, including her bathing water, was shipped from the U.S. to Thailand throughout the production. Furthermore, she was bathed in purified water every day. Young Thai men were hired to hold umbrellas over the elephant when the cameras were not shooting. Throughout filming, almost everything the elephant walked on was reinforced with timber and steel.<ref name="humane" /> Twelve elephants were also used as extras in the jungle mountain scenes.<ref name="humane" />

According to Denis Leary, "The movie was so painstakingly terrible — because it took a long time to shoot — that all of us actually had pictures of the things that we were gonna buy with our money to keep us going. I had a picture of this property in [[Connecticut]]. Ray Liotta had a picture of a house that he was building outside L.A., and Danny Glover had a picture of a property in San Francisco he was gonna buy. That's how we would get through it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1073718,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Dan |last=Snierson |title=Stupid Questions with Denis Leary |date=2005-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109040306/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1073718,00.html |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}</ref>

===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''Operation Dumbo Drop'', was released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 28, 1995. It features songs recorded by veteran musicians Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, and Jackie Wilson among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000OEO |title=Operation Dumbo Drop (Soundtrack) |accessdate=2010-08-18 |publisher=Amazon.com}}</ref> The music for the film was composed by David Newman; while being edited by Tom Villano.<ref name="movies.yahoo.com">{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800241087/cast |title=Operation Dumbo Drop (1995) |accessdate=2010-08-18 |publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}</ref> The sound effects in the film were supervised by William Jacobs. The mixing of the sound elements was orchestrated by Doc Kane.<ref name="movies.yahoo.com" /> "[[When I See an Elephant Fly]]" is taken from the Disney animated film, ''[[Dumbo (1941 film)|Dumbo]]'', with the music composed by [[Oliver Wallace]] and is the only Disney animated song to be soundtrack album on Hollywood Records. In 2017 [[Intrada Records]] released an expanded edition of Newman's score paired with Alex North's complete 17-minute score for ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Among mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mostly negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 31% of 26 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 4.0 out of 10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/operation_dumbo_drop/ Operation Dumbo Drop (1995)].

Hal Hinson, writing in ''The Washington Post'' said, the film is "so peculiar that one barely knows where to start." He noted that "the real audience for the film—the kids—will have not the slightest hint of all this. They'll be far too consumed—as well they should be—with the goofy antics of Bo-Tat, who, as movie elephants go, is actually pretty wonderful." In mixed fashion, he concluded by saying, "''Operation Dumbo Drop'' isn't a shoddy piece of work or a cynical one. It's well acted, well directed and far more interesting visually than most children's films. In its heart of hearts, though, it is more than slightly schizoid. On the one hand, it's a diverting entertainment for children and young adults; on the other, it's a ludicrous fantasy about a war whose complexities cannot be contained by facile metaphors."<ref>Hinson, Hal (July 28, 1995).

Retrieved 2010-08-18.</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' offered a mostly negative review commenting, "the story is so sentimentalized, so sanitized into a family comedy, that I do doubt the reality was anything like this." He expressed disappointment by saying, "There is a moment when Nguyen can shoot the elephant, but chooses not to, using dialogue that I somehow doubt was uttered by any member of the Viet Cong at any time: '' 'I did not join this army to shoot elephants - especially ones that fly.'''" In conclusion he sadly noted, "As a family movie, ''"Operation Dumbo Drop"'' is sort of entertaining. As history, it's shameless." In the ''Deseret News'', critic Chris Hicks reserved a mild compliment for some of the lead acting and directing saying, "Glover and Liotta play against each other pretty well, though there is none of the chemistry Glover has with Mel Gibson in the ''"Lethal Weapon"'' films." He noted how Director Wincer "moves things along quite well, and there is some impressive stunt work". But overall, he felt the film's screenplay was "strictly by-the-numbers stuff and contains some wildly implausible elements."<ref name="howe">Hicks, Chris (August 2, 1995).

Janet Maslin writing in ''The New York Times'' felt the film was at its most, "pleasantly innocuous when it doesn't strain itself with that kind of moralizing and instead concentrates on the logistical nightmare of elephant-moving. Beyond that, it doesn't have much plot, but the idea of tossing an elephant out of an airplane certainly makes for adequate suspense."<ref name="maslin" /> In comparison to other films, Maslin thought, "The model for this is a lot closer to ''"McHale's Navy"'', which is mentioned here, than it is to ''"Platoon"''. But in the end, this generally lighthearted Vietnam caper does try to teach a lesson of sorts, since the gift of an elephant becomes a form of war reparations."<ref name="maslin">Maslin, Janet (July 28, 1995).

Gary Kamiya of ''The San Francisco Examiner'' bluntly referred to the film as descending "upon the hapless viewer like a vast load of pachyderm dung."
