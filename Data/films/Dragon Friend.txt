'''Dragon Friend''' is a [[1998]] television cartoon, made by [[Walt Disney Television Animation]], and released as a winner of the "Create Story Magic" contest on the Disney Channel.

== Plot ==
The short begins with a little boy named Alec ([[Brady Bluhm]]) being chased by a band of knights. Managing to give his pursuers the slip, Alec falls off a cliff, only to be saved by a friendly dragon ([[Tony Jay]]) who introduces himself as Cloud Dancer, and knows all about Alec, explaining that any dragon who's old enough knows such things. When Alec says Cloud Dancer doesn't look so old, the elderly dragon points out he is the first dragon that Alec has ever seen and laments that dragons could live forever if humans didn't keep trying to slay them. Moving past these sad feelings, Cloud Dancer puts Alec on his head and takes him for a ride through the sky, even demonstrating his dragon fire by setting the surface of a lake ablaze.

Coming across the same knights who had been chasing Alec, Cloud Dancer goes on the attack. After easily swatting two of the warriors aside with his tail, Cloud Dancer drops Alec onto their captain's shoulders, using his magic to transform a stick of wood Alec has been carrying into a proper broadsword. The increased weight of the weapon smacks down on the knight's helm and sends him sprawling, leaving Alec to land in his horse's saddle. With the immediate threat gone, Cloud Dancer explains that group of knights was trying to make sure Alec never reaches adulthood, because he will grow to be far more than any mere knight. Alec will grow to become a protector of old dragons like Cloud Dancer and will be known as "Dragon Friend". Bidding his future champion farewell, Cloud Dancer takes off, shouting "Look for me in the clouds, Alec!"

Alec is knocked off the horse and lies unconscious. He wakes up in the modern world where everything he went through looked to be all but a dream. However, cloud in the shape of of Cloud Dancer moves over head as the short ends.
