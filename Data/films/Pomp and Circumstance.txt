{{Quote|When we hear Sir Edward Elgar's ''Pomp and Circumstance'', we think of a graduation ceremony. Actually, Elgar composed it for many kinds of solemn events. This march inspired the Disney artists to recreate the age-old story of Noah's Ark, with one slight twist...|[[James Levine]]|Fantasia 2000}}

"'''Pomp and Circumstance'''" is the seventh and penultimate segment from ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', set to the composition of the same name by Edward Elgar. Based on the story of [[Noah's Ark]] from the Book of Genesis, it stars [[Donald Duck]] in the role of [[Noah (character)|Noah]]'s first mate, as well as [[Daisy Duck]]. During the course of the segment, Donald musters the animals to the Ark and misses, but later reunites with Daisy in the process. The segment has also been used in the final 1 minute and 52 seconds of the closing credits, but omitted Donald, Daisy, and the animals.

==Synopsis==
As the time of God’s Great Flood to wipe out all land draws near, and at the request to build an ark to save his family, [[Noah (character)|Noah]] rounds up all animals from every corner of the globe and instructs his first mate, Donald Duck, to ensure that they all get onto the Ark in groups of two. Donald jumps out of his hammock in the middle of his relaxation and rushes off from his hut to get started, after Donald promises Daisy Duck that he’ll meet her onboard. The animals refuse to get on at first at Donald’s command, but after a bolt of lightning nearly strikes them, they frantically comply. The dragon, griffin, and unicorn sit by, laughing and mocking them. While he is checking them off on his list, Donald realizes that Daisy has not yet come aboard. He rushes back to their hut to get her, not seeing her get on as he does. Suddenly, The Great Flood begins as a giant wave crashes over their hut, washing it away. Daisy, who is watching from the Ark's window, doesn't see Donald rush back to the Ark in time and thinks he got washed away too. Similarly, Donald thinks the same thing about her as he failed to notice she wasn't still in the hut and both are saddened by the apparent loss of one another.

40 days and nights later, after the rain lets up, Donald sends out a male dove to check for land, angrily pulling him away from his mate whom he refuses to leave in the process. Upon seeing the female dove cry because her mate is gone, Donald realizes that he is missing Daisy more and more. Elsewhere on the Ark, Daisy looks at a picture of her and Donald that she keeps in a locket, and begins to feel the same way. Throughout the voyage, neither duck knows that the other is there.

The male dove soon returns with a twig from an olive tree. When the Ark lands and the water dries out, Donald looks on as the animals, some of which had young during the journey (for instance, the rabbits had at least 20 bunnies), climb off. As Noah and his family are leaving, he ruffles Donald's head feathers affectionately to congratulate him for a job well done, but Donald continues to feel sad about the apparent loss of Daisy. Elsewhere, Daisy is walking down the gangplank when she realizes that her locket has fallen off its chain. Going back to look for it, she finds it and bends down to pick it up. Donald, having noticed the locket as he stepped out to sweep up some dirt, reaches down to pick it up at the same time. They both see one another and are overjoyed to see that the other is alive. Daisy kisses Donald and they walk away together, arm in arm, to admire their new home under a beautiful rainbow.

<poem>
Land of hope and glory 
Mother of the free 
How shall we extol thee 
Who are born of thee? 
Wider still and wider 
Shall thy bounds be set 
God who made thee mighty 
Make thee mightier yet 
God who made thee mighty 
Make thee mightier yet
</poem>

== Development ==
"Pomp and Circumstance" was a piece selected for ''Fantasia 2000'' at the suggestion of [[Michael Eisner]], who was inspired by attending his son's college graduation, saying "''Pomp and Circumstance' probably has more pleasant associations in people's minds than any other piece of music, because it is always being played when you or someone you love are achieving something".''

Before the Noah's Ark storyline was chosen, Eisner and the executives wanted the sequence to feature as many Disney characters as possible and was centered on a procession of the [[Disney Princesses]], accompanied by their Princes and children, from [[Snow White]] up to Princess [[Jasmine]]. Numerous Disney characters in the audience could be seen watching this parade, but a certain set of characters were not invited: the [[Disney Villains]], who proceed to crash the party. Donald Duck was present in this story and tried to send the villains back by using the [[Sorcerer Hat|Sorcerer's Hat]], though his efforts to retrieve it provide a number of comedic gags. Eisner had hoped to invite many of the surviving members of the Nine Old Men to come back to animate their characters, but upon a screening of the story reel, they immediately rejected the proposal and called the sequence one of the most terrible things they had ever seen.<ref>http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2011/04/29/why-for-the-disney-princess-royal-processional-that-you-almost-got-to-see.aspx</ref>

"Pomp and Circumstance" eventually shifted to a Noah's Ark storyline, though with a dove in the role of Noah's assistant instead of Donald. Additionally, an alternative Donald Duck sequence was pitched in the form of an Icarus story set to Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries" and bumblebee story set to Rimsky-Korsakov's "Flight of the Bumblebee".

"Pomp and Circumstance" along with "[[The Carnival of the Animals]]" and "[[Symphony No. 5]]" were recorded on [[April 25]], [[1994]] by [[James Levine]] and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
