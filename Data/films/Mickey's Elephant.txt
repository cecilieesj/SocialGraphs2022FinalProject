'''''Mickey's Elephant''''' is an animated short released in [[1936]], notably marking the first animated appearance of [[Bobo the Elephant]] from the ''Mickey Mouse'' newspaper comic strip.

==Synopsis==
[[Mickey]] receives a baby elephant named Bobo as a gift from the Rajah of Gahboon. But [[Pluto]] isn't quite sure what to make of it, especially when he begins to suspect that he's being replaced.

This event is what brought Pluto's shoulder devil to come into picture, convincing Pluto that he will be replaced by Bobo. In an effort to get Bobo into trouble, the shoulder devil spotted some red pepper and gets Pluto to blow all of it into Bobo, causing the latter's trunk to itch.

Despite Mickey's attempts to tend Bobo, the latter sneezes incessantly, accidentally destroying both his house and Pluto's doghouse, much to both Mickey and Pluto's shock. However, the shoulder devil doesn't care and instead laughs at their misfortune, making Pluto realize in horror that he has been tricked to entertain the shoulder devil for fun. Outraged of being used, Pluto angrily smacks the shoulder devil with his paw, fuming in frustration over his actions.
