==Trivia==
*Co-hosted by [[Professor Owl]] and [[Ludwig Von Drake]]. At the beginning of the program, Professor Owl hosts. When "All in the Golden Afternoon" ends, Ludwig Von Drake takes over as host for a lecture on popular music styles. Finally, after "Blue Danube Waltz" is over, Professor Owl takes over as host for the rest of the program.
*The song ''Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing'' includes a montage with Disney birds from ''[[Bambi (film)|Bambi]]'' and the [[Silly Symphonies]] cartoon, ''[[Birds in the Spring]]''.
*''Boo Boo Boo'' is the only song that doesn't have text words with a Mickey Mouse icon as a "bouncing ball" appearing on the screen; this song has only the blue words with the crooner from ''A Symposium on Popular Songs'' bouncing on them.
*An edited version of the ''Old MacDonald Had a Band'' segment that appeared in this video was credited under ''Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom''. From a technical sense, this is actually correct, because it derived from an episode of the [[The Wonderful World of Disney|Walt Disney anthology series]] titled ''[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom (Walt Disney Presents episode)|Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom]]'' (season 5, episode 24), which aired on [[March 27]], [[1959]]. The unaltered version of ''Old MacDonald Had a Band'', which did not appear in this video, originated from the Disney short ''Jack and Old Mac''. However, the US and Japanese laserdiscs and UK VHS correctly credit the song under ''Jack and Old Mac''.
*This installment was the first to promote, and feature songs from, a then recently-released Disney film (in this case, ''[[Oliver & Company]]''). Prior to this, most installments promoted anniversary re-releases of older films. ''101 Notes of Fun'' was used to promote ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' in [[1994]].
*Retitled ''101 Notes of Fun'' in the UK and other countries, and was not released until 1994.
*[[Cruella De Vil (song)|Cruella De Vil]] appears in ''101 Notes of Fun'' and replaces "Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing". It also replaces the reprise of "Why Should I Worry".
*In the end credits, [[Eva Gabor]] is wrongly credited, as she did not sing any of the songs in ''[[The Aristocats]]'' ([[Robie Lester]] did). [[Roscoe Lee Browne]] (voice of [[Francis]] in ''[[Oliver & Company]]'') isn't credited here for his part in the reprise of "Why Should I Worry", but should have been as he sang in the final scene of aforementioned film.
*The end credits also use a still background of [[New York City]] from ''Oliver & Company''. The usual blue G-clef background is used instead in ''101 Notes of Fun''.
*Known as ''[[:es:Canta Con Nosotros|101 Dalmatas: Notas Musicales]]'' in Spanish, released in Spain. Also known as ''Canta Con Nosotros: 101 Dalmatas: 101 Notas Musicales''.
*Known as ''Les 101 Dalmatiens: 101 Notes de Musique'' in French, released in France.
*Known as 101 Dalmatiner: 101 Takte Spass in German, released in Germany.
*Known as 101 Dalmatiërs: 101 Puppies met muziek in Dutch, released in Netherlands.
*Known as La Carica Dei 101: 101 note in allegria in Italian, released in Italy.
*Known as 101 Dálmatas: 101 Notas De Alegria in Portuguese, released in Portugal.
*For "[[The Green with Envy Blues]]", rather than using the original [[Paul Frees]] version, the song is re-orchestrated and sung by Ludwig's current voice actor, [[Corey Burton]].
*Ludwig's hosting segments originate from ''[[A Symposium on Popular Songs]], [[An Adventure in Color/Mathmagicland|An Adventure in Color]]'' and ''[[A Square Peg in a Round Hole]]''.
*A fragment of the song "[[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom (song)|Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom]]" is briefly heard after the Blue Danube Waltz. Fittingly, the early Sing-Along Songs videos use footage from the [[Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom|short film of the same name]] as well as footage from ''[[Melody (Adventures in Music)|Melody]]'', though not credited.
*At the end of ''101 Notes of Fun'', an image of Pongo replaces the image of the New York City skyline from ''Oliver & Company'' on Professor Owl's chart, but when it switches to Pongo and Perdita and the puppies watching Professor Owl on television, the image on the chart switches back to the NYC skyline.
*The title card's letters is used strangely in all capital letters only in the German and Italian versions.
*The German version has the remixed opening theme shown on "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Friend Like Me|Friend Like Me]]", "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Circle of Life|Circle of Life]]", "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Honor to Us All|Honor to Us All]]", "Collection of All Time Favorites", "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs from Hercules|Hercules]]", Foreign languages of "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Colors of the Wind|Colors of the Wind]]" and "[[Disney's Sing-Along Songs: Topsy Turvy|Topsy Turvy]]"
